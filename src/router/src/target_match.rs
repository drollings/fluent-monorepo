//! Classifier-driven target matching — the in-group complexity ladder.
//!
//! VISION §"Target selection within a group": after the classifier resolves a
//! route to a `model_group`, each candidate target self-assesses the prompt's
//! complexity and defers to the next, more-intelligent member when the
//! assessed complexity exceeds its configured `intelligence`. The first target
//! whose `intelligence` meets or exceeds the assessed complexity — or the last
//! member of the group — actually answers, and its answer is recorded in the
//! session ledger.
//!
//! This module owns the *matching* concern only (§4.1 of the roadmap): the
//! pure selection core (`start_index` / `is_match`), the self-assessment
//! prompt + tolerant parse, and the I/O-bound `TargetMatcher` that runs the
//! climb. It deliberately knows nothing about HTTP dispatch, escalation, or
//! the ledger — those stay in `server/` and `dispatch/`.
//!
//! Both the flat classifier path (`stages::classifier`) and the
//! classification-tree engine (`stages::tree`) resolve through the *same*
//! `TargetMatcher` (DRY — one climbing implementation).
