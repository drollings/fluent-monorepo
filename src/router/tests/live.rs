//! Live-AI integration test crate for fluent-router.
//!
//! Compiled ONLY when the `live-ai` feature is enabled. Tests perform real
//! model calls and are `#[ignore]`d; they run exclusively via
//! `make test-live` / `make router-test-live`. See `tests/live/README.md` for
//! the env contract and skip-not-fail policy.
