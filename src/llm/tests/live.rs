//! Live-AI integration test crate for fluent-llm.
//!
//! Compiled ONLY when the `live-ai` feature is enabled. Tests perform real
//! model calls and are `#[ignore]`d; they run exclusively via
//! `make test-live` / `make llm-test-live`. See `tests/live/README.md` for the
//! env contract and skip-not-fail policy.
