# Fluent WVR = Fluent, Wrapped, Verified, Reflected.

**A design pattern guide for human coders and AI agents working in this Rust codebase.**

You are reading the document that defines the core concepts and conventions of 
this codebase's control plane. Its design patterns interlock for clean extensibility 
and composition.  It's not a silver bullet or a hammer to every nail, but the 
pervasive thread of forward-compatible design in this codebase.

---

## What is it?

The fluent-wvr document and its code is a collection of interlocking design 
patterns enabling consistent metadata for composable units of work, polymorphism 
where needed, schemas for datatypes internally and over IPC, and other single 
sources of truth.

---

## Why fluent-wvr exists

fluent-wvr is the **control plane** of this codebase: the layer that makes
components *composable and flexible* instead of hard-wired. It answers one
design question that every nontrivial system eventually hits — *"how do I let
the same orchestrator run very different things without a `match` statement
for every kind?"* — with a single, compiler-checked answer.

**It gives Rust the polymorphism other languages take for granted.** C++ and
Python express this with class inheritance: a base class with virtual methods,
or a subclass that overrides behavior. Entity Component Systems express it
differently: small, independently-composable pieces assembled per entity
rather than inherited. fluent-wvr does both in Rust terms:

- **Inheritance-like polymorphism** — the `Component`/`WorkUnit` trait is the
  "base class"; a native struct, a WASM plugin, and a database-driven config
  are all "subclasses" that can be swapped behind one `Arc<dyn Component>`
  handle.
- **ECS-like composition** — instead of deep type hierarchies, units declare
  what they *depend on* and *provide* (`depends()`/`provides()`), so an
  orchestrator composes behavior from independent pieces, exactly as an ECS
  composes entities from components.

The difference from C++/Python: **strong typing and Rust idioms are embraced,
not fought.** Polymorphism is *nominal and explicit* — an implementation must
declare the interface it satisfies, and the compiler checks every method
signature at compile time. There is no silent runtime method-miss (Python) and
no unchecked downcast (C++).

**It is a single source of truth for the control plane.** The struct
definition is authoritative: one `#[derive(FieldAccess, Describable)]` on a
type generates field access, validation, and a JSON Schema from the *same*
fields — so the accessor, the validator, the schema, and the interface glue
can never drift apart. You edit one definition; everything else follows.

FieldAccess definitions are intended expressly for configurable composable 
definitions, schemas, datatypes, and control planes.  Lacking FieldAccess 
definitions is not a problem for small units of work in hot paths.  Lacking 
forward compatibility with them in key control, schema, and definition surfaces 
is an anti-pattern in this codebase.

**What fluent-wvr is NOT for.** These patterns are for **control-plane
objects** — configuration, orchestration, interfaces, and the "glue" that
connects major types — not for every object processed in bulk. Do **not** wrap
the hot-path inner loops in trait objects: a vtable lookup per element is a
real cost when you process millions of items per second. That is why this
guide pairs every polymorphic pattern with its monomorphized alternative
(direct field access, generics, `first_accept_in_order`), and why the hot
paths in this codebase use concrete types or monomorphized functions while the
control plane uses `dyn Component`. **Rule of thumb: `dyn` at the request
boundary, concrete in the tight loop.**

**How the patterns contribute to better code, briefly:** they make unit tests
trivial (swap a real backend for a stub behind the same handle), make new
implementations additive (add a type, not a `match` arm), keep configuration
schema-complete and validated, and let cross-cutting concerns (timing, retry,
adaptation) attach without touching business logic — all at near-zero runtime
cost except where a vtable or serialization boundary genuinely exists.

## Who This Document Is For

**For humans coming from Python or C++**: Rust's trait system replaces inheritance, its ownership model replaces garbage collection, and its derive macros replace runtime reflection. This document shows how twelve composable patterns together give you Python's runtime ergonomics and C++'s polymorphic flexibility, with absolute memory safety and zero hidden cost.

**For AI agents**: This document is the authoritative reference for how code in this Rust `fluent-monorepo` is structured. When writing new code, check the pattern table in §1, find the applicable pattern, and follow the rules and anti-pattern sections.

> **Pattern status.** Every pattern is marked in one of three ways, because
> "in production use" is not uniform across the crate:
>
> - **Production** — composed by a live call path in this workspace (the
>   pipeline `Component` stages, `DependencyGraph`, `SupervisedBatch`, `Instrumented`,
>   `ResultPool`, the roadmap shared primitives).
> - **Compatibility surface (scaffold)** — the trait/type is derived and
>   contract-complete, but has no current production caller. It exists to keep
>   the `Component` interface uniform and forward-compatible for future
>   runtime assembly. These are **intentional**; do not prune them as dead
>   code. Examples: `FieldAccess`/`Describable` on router stages,
>   `PersistableComponent` (trait only, no implementor), `SchemaProvider`
>   (derive-only, never invoked in production), `DynamicComponent`.
> - **Planned** — described as the intended end-state but not yet built.

> Where this document says a pattern is "in production use," read it as
> *the pattern's composition path is production-real*; per-type reflection
> methods may still be scaffold.

### Reading this guide from Python, C++, Go, or stock Rust

The patterns here exist because Rust's toolbox differs from the languages
most programmers come from. Map the foreign concept to the Rust idiom before
reading a pattern:

| You know this | It maps to | Rust idiom in this crate |
|---|---|---|
| Python `getattr`/`setattr` | dynamic field access | `FieldAccess` (Pattern 2) — but *checked* and *validated* |
| Python `@decorator` | function wrapping | Newtype wrapper (Pattern 3) — compile-time, inlinable |
| Python duck typing | dynamic dispatch | `dyn Trait` + `Arc` (Pattern 4) — *static* dispatch, no runtime crash |
| C++ virtual methods / vtables | runtime polymorphism | `dyn Trait` + `Arc` (Pattern 4) — compiler generates the vtable |
| C++ templates | compile-time polymorphism | Generics / `impl Trait` — monomorphized, zero-cost |
| C++ constructor overloads | readable multi-arg init | `bon::Builder` (Pattern 1) |
| Go `interface{}` + type switch | erased heterogeneous values | `Arc<dyn Component>` + downcast (Patterns 4, 10) — *typed* |
| Go `struct` methods + embedding | method delegation | Trait delegation in wrappers (Patterns 3, 11) |
| Go `context.Context` | per-call config/flow | `WorkContext` (Pattern 8) — typed channels, no stringly-typed keys |
| Go goroutines + `sync.WaitGroup` | supervised concurrency | `Scope` / `SupervisedBatch` (fluent-concurrency) — structured, panic-aware |
| Stock Rust `enum` + `match` | exhaustive variant handling | Keep `enum` — but when N independent impls exist, prefer `dyn Trait` (Pattern 4) |

The guiding rule: **prefer the Rust idiom that a reader from another language
would have to fake by hand.** If your C++ self would write a vtable, use
`dyn Trait`; if your Python self would reach for `setattr`, reach for
`FieldAccess` — the compiler then enforces what the other language only
documents.

---

## The Core Thesis

**The one idea to take away before reading further:** this crate lets you write
code that *swaps implementations at runtime* — a WASM plugin, a native struct,
or a database-driven config — behind a single, compiler-checked interface, the
way Python's duck typing does, but with the safety of C++'s static types and
none of Go's `interface{}` boxing surprises. Everything below is a variation on
that single theme.

Every unit of work in this system — a DAG target, a WASM plugin, a query strategy, an embedding provider — presents the **same interface** to the orchestrator regardless of whether it was assembled at compile time or at runtime. The orchestrator iterates over uniform handles and calls trait methods. The compiler enforces the interface at every implementation site.

> **The one sanctioned exception.** `PipelineOrchestrator` (the router's
> hot path) downcasts `Arc<dyn Component>` to the two known stage types via
> `as_producer` (`pipeline.rs`) and calls `StageDecisionProducer::evaluate`
> directly — a typed handoff that avoids serializing each `StageDecision`
> through `WorkOutput.data` once per request. This is a measured exception to
> "never branch on type": it exists because a serialize→deserialize round-trip
> on the request path costs more than one downcast, and it falls back to the
> uniform `execute` path for unknown components. New code should **not** copy
> this pattern; it is reserved for the one place where the per-request
> serialization cost was measured and the downcast won.

The `Component` supertrait is the concrete expression of this principle:

```rust
pub trait Component: FieldAccess + Describable + WorkUnit + Send + Sync {
    fn as_any(&self) -> &dyn Any;
    fn as_any_mut(&mut self) -> &mut dyn Any;
}

// `impl_component!` writes the `as_any`/`as_any_mut` body — never hand-roll it.
impl_component!(MyConfig);
```

The `as_any`/`as_any_mut` methods are required for safe downcasting after
`Arc<dyn Component>` erasure. The `impl_component!` macro eliminates the
7-line boilerplate (it has a concrete-type arm and a `generic (bounds)`
arm for wrapper types). See §2 for the full definition and §5 for
wrapper usage.

This interface is valid for **both compile-time and runtime assembly**:

| Construction path | Resulting type | Interface |
|---|---|---|
| `bon::Builder` on a Rust struct | `Arc<dyn Component>` | Same |
| WASM plugin loaded at runtime | `Arc<dyn Component>` (via `WasmComponent` bridge) | Same |
| Database-driven config | `Arc<dyn Component>` (via `DynamicComponent`) | Same |
| Newtype wrapper at registration | `Arc<dyn Component>` | Same |
| `ComponentAdapter` at runtime | `Arc<dyn Component>` | Same |

The key design constraint: **construction reads like configuration, validation surfaces at exactly one point, dispatch is uniform, serialization is automatic, runtime configuration is type-safe, and cross-cutting concerns compose without modifying business logic.**

### The Full Pipeline

```

                           ↓
bon::Builder:      Generates chained setter methods at compile time (zero cost)
                           ↓
Validation:        build() returns Result; ? propagation at call site (type safety)
                           ↓
FieldAccess:       component.set_field("port", "9000")?  (runtime configuration)
                           ↓

                           ↓

```

## 1. Pattern Table

**What this is.** The index of all twelve patterns at a glance — what problem
each solves and its cost. Use it to navigate: find the row for your situation,
then jump to that section. The "cost" column matters: the patterns are nearly
free (derive macros, wrappers, RAII) except where a vtable or a serialization
boundary genuinely exists.

Twelve patterns compose into a single coherent architecture.

| Pattern | Problem solved | Cost | Primary source |
|---------|---------------|------|---------------|
| **Fluent Builder** | Multi-parameter init that callers can't read | Zero — `#[derive(bon::Builder)]` | `dag/src/target.rs` |
| **Trait-Based Reflection** | Schema defined in multiple places; runtime config by name | Zero — `serde` + `FieldAccess` derive | `fluent-wvr-macros/src/lib.rs` |
| **Trait Composition** | Cross-cutting logic duplicated across handlers | Zero — newtype wrappers | `fluent-wvr/src/wrapper.rs` |
| **Trait Objects** | Runtime polymorphism with branching in hot loops | One vtable pointer per `dyn Trait` | `llm/src/embeddings.rs` |
| **Binary IPC** | Executing untrusted code across a WASM boundary | Memcpy + `#[repr(C, packed)]` | `wasm_ipc/src/lib.rs` |
| **Scoped Ownership** | Repeated malloc/free in batch processing | Zero — RAII scope drop | Throughout |
| **Newtype Handles** | ID type confusion across module boundaries | Zero — same representation | `guidance-types/src/lib.rs` |
| **Unit of Work** | Uniform orchestration of heterogeneous tasks | One trait impl per task | `dag/src/work_unit.rs` |
| **Middleware Chain** | Composable cross-cutting on trait objects | One allocation per layer | `dag/src/middleware.rs` |
| **Component Adapter** | Runtime type adaptation without losing uniform interface | One `Arc` per adapter | `fluent-wvr/src/wrapper.rs` (`ComponentAdapter`; `dag/src/adapter.rs` is a backward-compat re-export) |
| **Structured Logging Context** | Request-scoped observability without manual context passing | Thread-local storage | `fluent-wvr/src/wrapper.rs` (Instrumented) |
| **Runtime Composition** | Full lifecycle: build → configure → wrap → execute → inspect | Zero — uses above patterns | Throughout |

## 2. The Component Interface in Detail

**What problem this solves.** If you come from Python, think of `Component` as
a *duck type that the compiler checks*: any type can be wrapped in
`Arc<dyn Component>` and driven uniformly, but only if it satisfies four
sub-interfaces the compiler verifies at compile time. If you come from C++,
it is an abstract base class with `virtual` methods — except the vtable is
generated for you and `Send + Sync` bounds prevent data races at compile time.
If you come from Go, it is an `interface` that *forces* you to implement every
method (no optional "this one panics if you call it").

Understanding this section is a prerequisite for every pattern below. All patterns either produce a `Component`, consume one, or compose with one. The four sub-interfaces split along two axes:

- **Who drives it:** the *orchestrator* (uniform dispatch) vs. the *configurator* (runtime field access).
- **What it knows:** a `WorkUnit` knows how to run; `FieldAccess`/`Describable` describe and configure.

### Trait definitions (the essential shapes)

```rust
// ── Orchestrator-facing: what the scheduler/dispatcher can do with it ──
pub trait WorkUnit: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn depends(&self) -> &[ArcIntern<str>];   // assets this unit needs
    fn provides(&self) -> &[ArcIntern<str>];  // assets this unit produces
    fn execute(&self, ctx: &WorkContext) -> Result<WorkOutput, WorkError>;
    fn default_timeout_ms(&self) -> u64 { 30_000 }   // override per unit
    fn type_name(&self) -> &'static str { std::any::type_name::<Self>() }
}

// ── Configurator-facing: runtime access by field name (Python's setattr) ──
pub trait FieldAccess {
    fn set_field(&mut self, name: &str, value: &str) -> Result<(), FieldError>;
    fn get_field(&self, name: &str) -> Result<String, FieldError>;
    fn field_names(&self) -> &'static [&'static str];
}

// Schema description (drives MCP tool validation / TUI editors).
pub trait Describable {
    fn describe(&self) -> serde_json::Value;
}

// ── The union: every fully-featured unit is all four + downcast support ──
pub trait Component: FieldAccess + Describable + WorkUnit + Send + Sync {
    fn as_any(&self) -> &dyn Any;       // safe downcast after dyn erasure
    fn as_any_mut(&mut self) -> &mut dyn Any;
}
```

`impl_component!(T)` writes the two `as_any` bodies for you — never hand-roll
them. It has a concrete-type arm (`impl_component!(MyConfig)`) and a generic
arm for wrapper types
(`impl_component!(generic (U: Component + 'static) for Instrumented<U>)`).
For units with **no configurable fields**, `impl_fieldless!(T)` also writes
the `FieldAccess` no-op trio. There is **no blanket
`impl<T: ...> Component for T`** — it would collide with
`impl Component for Arc<dyn Component>`; the macro is the mechanism.

The full annotated definitions (every `FieldError` variant, the
`SchemaProvider`/`PersistableComponent` scaffold types, the `Arc<dyn
Component>` blanket-impl details) live in `src/fluent-wvr/src/traits.rs` —
read them there when you need the complete contract, not here.

> **The one subtle requirement to remember:** `field_names` and `describe` are
> `&self` **instance** methods, not `static fn`s. A static associated function
> is not object-safe — you could not call it through `Arc<dyn Component>`.
> This is why the derive macro emits instance methods.

### The purity contract of `execute`

`WorkUnit::execute` MUST be synchronous, non-blocking, and free of side effects
beyond its return value:

- NO `tokio::spawn`, `tokio::time::sleep`, or `Handle::block_on` inside it.
- NO blocking I/O — emit a `WorkError` instead and let the `SupervisedBatch`
  supervisor handle retry/backoff/timeout.
- NO mutation of shared state without synchronization.

Violations defeat the supervisor's timeout and retry invariants. This is why
`DbWorkUnit` (Pattern 8) offloads blocking rusqlite work to a blocking thread
instead of doing it inline.

### Error and output types

`WorkError` and `WorkOutput` are the data flow types for `WorkUnit::execute`.

```rust
pub enum WorkError {
    Execution(String),                      // sync failure → SupervisedBatchSummary::failed
    Dependency(String),                     // a depends() asset not yet provides()'d
    Timeout { duration_ms: u64, unit: String },  // wall-clock budget exhausted → cancelled
}

pub struct WorkOutput {
    pub success: bool,
    pub message: String,
    pub data: serde_json::Value,
}
```

The three-way `WorkError` taxonomy matters: the `SupervisedBatch` supervisor
discriminates on it — `Execution` lands in `summary.failed`, `Timeout` lands
in `summary.cancelled`, and only a task *panic* (a `JoinError::is_panic()`)
lands in `summary.panicked`. Do not overload `Execution` for the other two.
`WorkOutput::typed::<T>` / `data_take::<T>` serialize typed payloads into
`data`; `ok`/`ok_with_data`/`fail` are the plain constructors. Full
constructors and `Display` live in `src/fluent-wvr/src/work.rs`.

### Execution context

`WorkContext` carries the per-call configuration plus a `Runtime` and
a `CapabilitySet`. The default uses `NoopRuntime` and an empty
capability set; `SupervisedBatch` overrides both at registration time.

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct WorkContext {
    pub dry_run: bool,                   // short-circuit mutating handlers
    pub max_retries: u32,                // 0 = no retry; >0 = SupervisedBatch retries this many times
    pub timeout_ms: u64,                 // per-attempt wall-clock budget
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, MetadataValue>,
    pub outputs: OutputStore,            // typed inter-unit channel
    pub rt: Arc<dyn Runtime>,            // pluggable: TokioRuntime, TestRuntime, NoopRuntime
    pub caps: CapabilitySet,             // type-erased capability tokens
}
```

**Channel decision rule). ** Four channels coexist on `WorkContext`
(and `WorkOutput`); pick the narrowest one that fits:

| Channel | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `outputs` (`OutputStore`, typed `HashMap<String, Arc<dyn Any + Send + Sync>>`) | **Primary** in-process handoff between units and stages. `set::<T>(key, value)` / `get::<T>(key) -> Option<&T>`; clone shares arcs. No serialize/deserialize. | `StageDecision`, retry-attempt counter (`i64`) |
| `structured: HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>` | Structured handoff of **arbitrary JSON payloads whose type is not known at compile time**. `set_structured(key, &T)` serializes, `structured::<T>(key)` deserializes — the *only* place that does `to_value`/`from_value` for the channel. Crosses crate boundaries as `Value` only (never a domain type). | `RouterRequest` under `"request"`, bound chart entities (`"entities"`), per-stage outputs (`"stage.{id}"`) |
| `WorkOutput.data: serde_json::Value` | **Only** for serialization boundaries (process/RPC/JSON handoff) and the final unit return value. `typed::<T>()` / `data_take::<T>()` | PipelineResult returned to the HTTP handler |
| `metadata: HashMap<String, MetadataValue>` | Only for genuinely stringly-typed / dynamic annotations that must survive serialization. | `classifier_system_prompt` (external config key), tags |

Use `outputs` for concrete, typed handoffs; use `structured` when the payload
is JSON whose concrete type is unknown at the write site (or crosses crate
boundaries); fall back to `data`/`metadata` only where the boundary truly
requires serialization. The router's stages use `structured["request"]` for
the live request and `outputs` for typed decisions; see `pipeline.rs`.

```rust
impl Default for WorkContext { /* dry_run=false, max_retries=0, timeout_ms=30_000, outputs: OutputStore::default(), NoopRuntime */ }

impl WorkContext {
    /// Build a context for a single unit, using its `default_timeout_ms()`.
    pub fn for_unit(unit: &dyn WorkUnit, caps: CapabilitySet) -> Self;

    /// Build a context that inherits the SupervisedBatch.s `rt` and `caps`, with
    /// optional per-unit overrides via a closure. The intended
    /// registration-site helper — `SupervisedBatch::register` uses it internally.
    pub fn for_unit_in_batch(
        batch_rt: &Arc<dyn Runtime>,
        batch_caps: &CapabilitySet,
        mutate: impl FnOnce(&mut WorkContext),
    ) -> Self;

    /// Store a typed value under `key` for in-process handoff
    pub fn set<T: Send + Sync + 'static>(&mut self, key: impl Into<String>, value: T);

    /// Borrow a typed value by `key`; `None` if absent or of a different type.
    pub fn get<T: Send + Sync + 'static>(&self, key: &str) -> Option<&T>;
}
```

### The canonical prelude

```rust
use fluent_wvr::prelude::*;
// Brings in: Component, WorkUnit, FieldAccess, Describable, FieldError,
// WorkContext, WorkError, WorkOutput, OutputStore, Capability, CapabilitySet,
// DynamicComponent, DynamicExecutor, impl_component, impl_fieldless,
// retry_call, ComponentAdapter, ComponentCascade, ExecuteFn, Instrumented,
// Middleware, MiddlewareChain, Pipeline, SuffixedComponent, MetadataValue,
// ArcIntern.
```

> `ComponentArcExt`, `FieldSchema`, `SchemaProvider`, and
> `PersistableComponent` are **not** in the prelude — they are niche
> types that should be imported from `fluent_wvr::traits` or
> `fluent_wvr::capability` when actually needed. The milestone
> removed them from the prelude because no consumer in the in-tree
> call graph imported them through the prelude.

> **Critical design note on `field_names` and `describe`:** Both are defined as `&self` instance methods, not static associated functions. This is deliberate: it makes them callable through `dyn Component`. A `fn field_names() -> &'static [&'static str]` associated function is not object-safe and cannot be dispatched through a trait object. Always use the instance method form.

### FieldAccess mutability and interior mutability

`set_field` takes `&mut self`, which requires mutable access to the concrete type. For trait objects stored in shared registries (`Arc<dyn Component>`), this means callers need `Arc::get_mut` (exclusive ownership) or the implementation must use interior mutability:

```rust
// Pattern A: exclusive ownership (configure before sharing)
let mut component = ToolConfig::builder().port(8080).build()?;
component.set_field("port", "9000")?;
let shared: Arc<dyn Component> = Arc::new(component);

// Pattern B: interior mutability inside the implementation
pub struct WasmComponent {
    config: Mutex<HashMap<String, String>>,  // interior mutability
    plugin: Mutex<extism::Plugin>,
}

impl FieldAccess for WasmComponent {
    fn set_field(&mut self, name: &str, value: &str) -> Result<(), FieldError> {
        // self is &mut, but we could also offer a set_field_shared(&self, ...) variant
        self.config.lock().unwrap().insert(name.to_string(), value.to_string());
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

The rule: **configure Rust-struct components before wrapping in `Arc`; configure WASM/dynamic components through their internal `Mutex`.**

---

## 3. Pattern 1 — Fluent Builder

**What problem this solves.** If you come from C++, you have experienced the
unreadable constructor call — seven positional arguments where the fourth one
is a mystery (`Target t("build", Type::File, ..., true, "extra")`). Python
fixes this with keyword args but pushes errors to runtime. Go leaves you
writing a constructor that takes a config struct or a chain of setter methods
by hand. This pattern gives you the best of all three: a readable, named,
compile-time-checked construction path with **zero runtime cost** — the
builder is generated by a derive macro and the compiler inlines it away.

### The problem

```cpp
// C++: Can you tell what the 4th argument means?
Target t("build", TargetType::File, {"compile", "link"}, {"artifact"}, true, "extra");
```

```python
# Python: kwargs help, but errors surface at runtime, mid-construction
target = Target(name="build", depends=["compile"], provides=["artifact"], essential=True)
```

### The Rust solution

`#[derive(bon::Builder)]` generates zero-boilerplate fluent builders. Validation moves to `build()` or a separate `register()` step. The `?` operator replaces error accumulation.

### Canonical implementation: `Target` in `dag/src/target.rs`

```rust
use bon::Builder;
use bitvec::vec::BitVec;
use internment::ArcIntern;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Builder)]
#[builder(start_fn = new)]
pub struct Target {
    pub id: i64,
    pub name: ArcIntern<str>,
    pub target_type: TargetType,
    pub executor: ExecutorKind,
    pub depends: BitVec,
    pub provides: BitVec,
    #[builder(default)]
    pub command: String,
    #[builder(default = false)]
    pub essential: bool,
}
```

**Call site:**

```rust
let target = Target::new()
    .id(1)
    .name("build".into())
    .target_type(TargetType::File)
    .executor(ExecutorKind::Native)
    .depends(registry.capabilities().to_bitvec(&["compile", "link"]))
    .provides(registry.capabilities().to_bitvec(&["artifact"]))
    .command("cargo build --release".into())
    .essential(true)
    .build();

registry.register(target)?;
```

### Fallible two-step construction

When construction involves fallible validation (string interning into bitset indices), separate infallible argument collection from fallible registration:

```rust
// Step 1: infallible — bon builder collects arguments
let args = TargetCreateArgs::builder()
    .name("build".into())
    .target_type(TargetType::File)
    .build();

// Step 2: fallible — registry validates and allocates
let target = registry.validate_and_allocate(args)?;
```

### Rules

- **Always derive `bon::Builder`** for structs with 4+ fields. Never write manual builder structs.
- **Use `#[builder(default)]`** for optional fields. Use `#[builder(default = value)]` for non-trivial defaults.
- **Use `#[builder(start_fn = new)]`** to generate `Type::new()` as the entry point.
- **Validation belongs in `build()` or `register()`, not in setters.**
- **Decouple construction from registration.** `Target::builder().build()` produces an owned `Target`; `registry.register(target)` commits it.
- **Do NOT apply to structs with 2–3 parameters.** Three params are already readable.

### When to avoid

- **2–3 parameters with no validation:** A struct literal or `fn new()` is already readable.
- **Performance-critical construction in hot loops:** Construction of millions of instances per second — use direct construction.
- **Single-use internal structs:** If the struct is only constructed in one place and never exposed.

---

## 4. Pattern 2 — Trait-Based Reflection

**What problem this solves.** If you come from Python, you are used to
`setattr(config, "port", 9000)` — convenient, but with no compile-time
checking, no validation, and no schema. C++ has no runtime reflection at all.
Go's `reflect` is verbose and slow. This pattern gives you a **layered
reflection ladder**: pick the cheapest tier that fits, from plain field access
(free) up to a validated, schema-typed `FieldAccess` (for runtime field names)
— with serde at the boundary. The single source of truth is the struct
definition; derive macros generate access, validation, and schema from it.

### The Boundary Rule

**Data that arrives from outside the process is always a string at the boundary. Data moving inside the process is not a string and should never be treated as one.**

This governs which of the four reflection tiers to use.

### The problem

```python
# Python: getattr/setattr at runtime — convenient, but:
# - No compile-time checking
# - No permission model
# - No schema description
# - String hashing at every access
setattr(config, "port", 9000)
```

### Four tiers of reflection

| Tier | Mechanism | Relative cost | When to use |
|------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | Direct field access | 1x (baseline) | Hot inner loops, trusted internal code |
| 2 | `serde` boundary serialization | ~10x | Boundary crossing, type known at compile time |
| 3 | `FieldAccess` trait | ~20x | Field names from runtime data; config editors, WASM configs |
| 4 | `HashMap` fallback | ~12–20x† | Schema genuinely unknown until runtime |

†`HashMap` cost is dominated by hashing and heap allocation, not a string match. For types with many fields, a generated `match` (Tier 3) is often faster than `HashMap::get` (Tier 4). Do not assume Tier 4 is always cheaper than Tier 3.

#### Tier 1: Direct field access

```rust
config.port = 9001;
let port = config.port;
```

#### Tier 2: `serde` boundary serialization

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct Config {
    #[serde(default = "default_port")]
    pub port: u16,
    #[serde(default = "default_host")]
    pub host: ArcIntern<str>,
}

fn default_port() -> u16 { 8080 }
fn default_host() -> ArcIntern<str> { "localhost".into() }

let config: Config = serde_json::from_str(json)?;
```

#### Tier 3: `FieldAccess` derive macro

```rust
#[derive(FieldAccess, Describable, bon::Builder)]
pub struct ToolConfig {
    #[field(desc = "TCP listen port", min = 1, max = 65535)]
    pub port: u16,
    #[field(desc = "Host address", max_len = 255)]
    pub host: String,
    #[field(desc = "Enable verbose logging")]
    pub verbose: bool,
    #[field(desc = "API endpoint URL", pattern = "https://")]
    pub endpoint: String,
    #[field(desc = "Display name", sanitize = "trim,lowercase")]
    pub name: String,
}
```

> **Note:** Patterns are substring matches, not regex. The value must contain the pattern string.

The derive macro generates this implementation:

```rust
impl FieldAccess for ToolConfig {
    fn set_field(&mut self, name: &str, value: &str) -> Result<(), FieldError> {
        match name {
            "port" => {
                let wide: f64 = value.parse().map_err(|_| FieldError::Parse(
                    format!("invalid u16 for 'port': {}", value)
                ))?;
                if wide < 1.0 {
                    return Err(FieldError::Constraint("port: value below minimum 1".into()));
                }
                if wide > 65535.0 {
                    return Err(FieldError::Constraint("port: value above maximum 65535".into()));
                }
                self.port = wide as u16;
                Ok(())
            }
            "host" => { self.host = value.to_string(); Ok(()) }
            "verbose" => {
                self.verbose = value.parse().map_err(|_| FieldError::Parse(
                    format!("invalid bool for 'verbose': {}", value)
                ))?;
                Ok(())
            }
            _ => Err(FieldError::NotFound(name.into()))
        }
    }

    fn get_field(&self, name: &str) -> Result<String, FieldError> {
        match name {
            "port"    => Ok(self.port.to_string()),
            "host"    => Ok(self.host.clone()),
            "verbose" => Ok(self.verbose.to_string()),
            _ => Err(FieldError::NotFound(name.into()))
        }
    }

    fn field_names(&self) -> &'static [&'static str] {
        &["port", "host", "verbose"]
    }
}

impl Describable for ToolConfig {
    fn describe(&self) -> serde_json::Value {
        serde_json::json!({
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "port":    { "type": "integer", "minimum": "1", "maximum": "65535",
                             "description": "TCP listen port" },
                "host":    { "type": "string", "description": "Host address" },
                "verbose": { "type": "boolean", "description": "Enable verbose logging" }
            },
            "required": ["port", "host", "verbose"]
        })
    }
}
```

#### Tier 4: `HashMap` fallback

When the schema is genuinely unknown at compile time (WASM plugin exports its schema, database-driven schemas):

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use internment::ArcIntern;

pub type DynamicConfig = HashMap<ArcIntern<str>, serde_json::Value>;

config.insert("port".into(), serde_json::json!(9000));

let port: u16 = config.get("port")
    .and_then(|v| v.as_u64())
    .ok_or(ConfigError::MissingField("port"))? as u16;
```

### Decision tree

```
Is the access in a hot loop?
  YES → Tier 1: direct field access
  NO  → Is data arriving from outside the process?
    YES → Is the type known at compile time?
      YES → Tier 2: serde (Deserialize)
      NO  → Is the schema known at runtime but values are typed?
        YES → Implement FieldAccess manually (Tier 3)
        NO  → Tier 4: HashMap<ArcIntern<str>, serde_json::Value>
    NO  → Tier 1: direct field access

Is a field name known only at runtime (config editor, WASM config)?
  YES → Tier 3: FieldAccess
  NO  → Tier 1 or Tier 2 per above
```

### Rules

- **Every `FieldAccess` implementation must also implement `Describable`.** The schema is the single source of truth — field access without a schema description is incomplete.
- **Use `serde` for all boundary serialization.** JSON, database rows, RPC.
- **Never call `set_field` in a hot loop.** Use Tier 1.
- **Never add `FieldAccess` to a type that never crosses a boundary.** It adds code for no benefit.

## 5. Pattern 3 — Trait Composition (Cross-Cutting Concerns)

**What problem this solves.** If you come from Python, you know the decorator
`@timing @retry(max=3)` — transparent wrapping, but the wrappers are runtime
closures that are hard to type and impossible to inline. C++ solves this with
CRTP or template mixins, which are notoriously cryptic. Go has no clean answer
(you hand-write a wrapper struct per concern). This pattern gives you
Python's decorator ergonomics with C++'s zero-cost inlining: a *newtype
wrapper* implements the same trait as the inner type and adds one
cross-cutting concern. The compiler inlines the wrapper when it can.

### The problem

```python
@timing
@retry(max=3)
def ingest_yago(path: str) -> None:
    # business logic
```

Python decorators execute at import time and wrap functions transparently. They're runtime closures and can be hard to type correctly.

### The Rust solution

Newtype wrappers around trait implementations. Each wrapper implements the same trait, delegating to the inner type while adding its cross-cutting concern. The compiler monomorphizes or dispatches through `dyn Trait`.

### Canonical shape: `Instrumented<U>`

```rust
pub struct Instrumented<U> {
    inner: U,
    label: String,                                     // owned, not &'static str
    histogram: Option<Arc<LatencyHistogram>>,          // optional metrics sink
}

impl<U: WorkUnit> Instrumented<U> {
    pub fn new(inner: U, label: impl Into<String>) -> Self { /* … */ }
    pub fn with_metrics(
        inner: U, label: impl Into<String>, histogram: Arc<LatencyHistogram>,
    ) -> Self { /* … */ }
}

impl<U: WorkUnit> WorkUnit for Instrumented<U> {
    fn name(&self) -> &str { self.inner.name() }   // delegates, does NOT shadow
    fn depends(&self) -> &[ArcIntern<str>] { self.inner.depends() }
    fn provides(&self) -> &[ArcIntern<str>] { self.inner.provides() }

    fn execute(&self, ctx: &WorkContext) -> Result<WorkOutput, WorkError> {
        let start = Instant::now();
        let result = self.inner.execute(ctx);
        if let Some(ref hist) = self.histogram {
            hist.observe_duration(start);
        }
        info!(target: "instrumented", label = %self.label,
              elapsed = ?start.elapsed(), name = %self.inner.name(), "executed");
        result
    }
}
impl_component!(generic (U: Component + 'static) for Instrumented<U>);
```

The wrapper also implements `FieldAccess` (delegating `set_field`/`get_field`/`field_names` to the inner) and `Describable` (delegates to inner). `set_field` is *not* rejected — it forwards to the inner type, which requires exclusive access to the inner (`&mut U`) or interior mutability inside the implementation. The `name()` call passes through to the inner type — `Instrumented` does not rename the unit; it only adds observability.

### Retry

- **Async transport retry**: `common_core::retry::retry_async(max_attempts,
  base_ms, jitter_pct, is_retryable, op)` — used by `RetryBackend` and the
  `SupervisedBatch` supervisor. `SupervisedBatch` drives per-attempt timeout, `WorkError::Timeout`
  routing, and dependency cancellation on top of it.
- **Sync free-function retry**: `retry_call(max_attempts, base_ms, f)` —
  the documented, explicitly-blocking counterpart for non-async contexts
  (tests, CLI helpers). It delegates its delay to
  `common_core::retry::backoff_ms` and must never be called from a
  `WorkUnit::execute` body.

```rust
// async transport retry (canonical):
let resp = common_core::retry::retry_async(3, 1000, 0, DispatchError::is_retryable, || async {
    client.post(&url).json(&body).send().await
}).await?;

// sync free-function retry (explicitly blocking — not for execute):
let retried = retry_call(3, 50, || parse_file(path))?;
```

For async retry with supervision, use the `SupervisedBatch` supervisor (Pattern in
`fluent-concurrency`), which routes the underlying error to
`SupervisedBatchSummary::failed` and runs `execute` on a fresh task budget per attempt.

### Application at the registration site

Apply wrappers **before** type erasure — this is the only point where the compiler can inline through the wrapper. Once stored as `Arc<dyn WorkUnit>`, you must use Middleware (Pattern 9) instead.

```rust
// Compose before type erasure: wraps are inlined
let unit = Instrumented::new(MyWorkUnit::new(), "ingest_yago");
registry.push(Arc::new(unit));   // one vtable boundary total
```

### Composition order (outer to inner)

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Rate limiting — reject early if overloaded |
| 2 | Auth — reject early if unauthorized |
| 3 | Tracing — start span |
| 4 | Timing — measure full duration |
| 5 | Retry — retry on transient failure |
| 6 | Validation — validate input |
| 7 | Core handler |

### Rules

- **Wrappers must implement the same trait as the inner type.**
- **Apply wrappers at the registration site, before type erasure.**
- **Do NOT wrap when there is only one implementation.**
- **Use `impl Trait` or generics for hot paths** to allow inlining.

### When to avoid

- After type erasure (use Middleware, Pattern 9).
- When the wrapper doesn't add any cross-cutting concern.
- When the wrapper changes the interface (use Adapter, Pattern 10).

## 6. Pattern 4 — Trait Objects (Runtime Polymorphism)

**What problem this solves.** This is the pattern C++ programmers know as
virtual methods, Python programmers know as duck typing, and Go programmers
know as interfaces. The difference is *where* the safety lives. In Python, a
typo in the method signature crashes at runtime. In Go, `interface{}` erases
all type information and forces manual type switches. Here, `dyn Trait` +
`Arc` gives you runtime dispatch with **compile-time verification** that every
implementation satisfies the full interface and is `Send + Sync`.

### The problem

```cpp
// C++: vtable per class hierarchy, hidden in the ABI
class Engine { virtual std::vector<Row> query(std::string sql) = 0; };
```

```python
# Python: duck typing — convenient but zero static safety
def run_query(engine, sql):
    return engine.query(sql)  # crashes at runtime if wrong method signature
```

### The Rust solution

`dyn Trait` + `Arc<dyn Trait>` for shared ownership. The compiler generates the vtable. `Send + Sync` bounds enforce thread safety at every implementation site.

### Canonical implementation: `EmbeddingProvider`

```rust
pub trait EmbeddingProvider: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn dimensions(&self) -> u32;
    fn embed(&self, text: &str) -> Result<Vec<f32>, EmbeddingError>;
    fn embed_batch(&self, texts: &[&str]) -> Result<BatchEmbedding, EmbeddingError>;
}

pub struct ProviderRegistry {
    providers: Vec<Arc<dyn EmbeddingProvider>>,
}

impl ProviderRegistry {
    pub fn register(&mut self, provider: Arc<dyn EmbeddingProvider>) {
        self.providers.push(provider);
    }
    pub fn get(&self, name: &str) -> Option<Arc<dyn EmbeddingProvider>> {
        self.providers.iter().find(|p| p.name() == name).cloned()
    }
}
```

### Trait objects vs. generics

| Scenario | Use | Why |
|----------|-----|-----|
| 2+ implementations, stored in registry | `dyn Trait` + `Arc` | Uniform handles, shared ownership |
| Single implementation, hot loop | `<T: Trait>` or `impl Trait` | Zero-cost monomorphization |
| Single implementation, not hot | Concrete type | No indirection needed |
| Plugin system (WASM, dynamic load) | `dyn Trait` + `Arc` | Runtime-discovered implementations |

### Serializing trait objects

Rust cannot serialize `dyn Trait` directly. Use a tagged enum wrapper:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[serde(tag = "type")]
pub enum ProviderConfig {
    Ollama { model: String, base_url: String },
    OpenAi { model: String, api_key: String },
}
```

### Component serialization (deferred)

Adding `Serialize` to the `Component` trait would require every implementor to be serializable — a breaking change for types holding `Arc<dyn Provider>`, `Mutex<Plugin>`, etc. A `PersistableComponent` trait stub exists in `fluent-wvr/src/traits.rs` as a design placeholder. Do NOT implement it until a second consumer materializes that needs to persist component state.

### Rules

1. **Always add `Send + Sync`** to traits stored in registries or shared across threads.
2. **Use `Arc<dyn Trait>` for shared ownership.** Use `Box<dyn Trait>` only for exclusive ownership.
3. **Never use `dyn Trait` with only one implementation.** Use the concrete type.
4. **Never create a trait speculatively.** Start with a concrete type; add the trait when the second implementation arrives.

---

## 7. Pattern 5 — Binary IPC (`#[repr(C, packed)]`)

**What problem this solves.** When you execute untrusted or dynamically loaded
code (a WASM plugin), you cross a trust boundary: the guest cannot hand you a
Rust `&[u8]` or a struct pointer. Every language solves this with a byte
protocol — Python's `struct.pack`, C++'s `reinterpret_cast` (unsafe), Go's
`encoding/binary`. Here the answer is an explicitly encoded, versioned,
zero-copy message format: `#[repr(C, packed)]` removes padding, and you
encode/decode with `to_le_bytes()`/`from_le_bytes()` — never `transmute`.

### The problem

When executing untrusted or dynamically loaded code (WASM tools), you need a safe, portable, zero-copy message format that works across the host/guest boundary.

### The Rust solution

`#[repr(C, packed)]` removes padding. Encode/decode explicitly with `to_le_bytes()` / `from_le_bytes()`. Validate magic and version before reading any other field. Never use `transmute`.

### Struct definitions in `wasm_ipc/src/lib.rs`

```rust
#[repr(C, packed)]
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct BinaryHeader {
    pub magic: [u8; 4],
    pub version: u32,
    pub payload_type: u32,
    pub payload_size: u32,
    pub checksum: u32,
}

#[repr(C, packed)]
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct BinaryExecutionRequest {
    pub header: BinaryHeader,
    pub target_id: i64,
    pub input_offset: u32,
    pub input_len: u32,
    pub flags: u32,
}

#[repr(C, packed)]
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct BinaryExecutionResult {
    pub header: BinaryHeader,
    pub success: u32,
    pub error_code: u32,
    pub output_offset: u32,
    pub output_len: u32,
    pub provides_words_offset: u32,
    pub provides_words_count: u32,
}
```

### Encoding and decoding

```rust
pub fn encode_request(req: &BinaryExecutionRequest, input: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
    let mut buf = Vec::with_capacity(
        std::mem::size_of::<BinaryExecutionRequest>() + input.len()
    );
    buf.extend_from_slice(&req.header.magic);
    buf.extend_from_slice(&req.header.version.to_le_bytes());
    buf.extend_from_slice(&req.header.payload_type.to_le_bytes());
    buf.extend_from_slice(&req.header.payload_size.to_le_bytes());
    buf.extend_from_slice(&req.header.checksum.to_le_bytes());
    buf.extend_from_slice(&req.target_id.to_le_bytes());
    buf.extend_from_slice(&req.input_offset.to_le_bytes());
    buf.extend_from_slice(&req.input_len.to_le_bytes());
    buf.extend_from_slice(&req.flags.to_le_bytes());
    buf.extend_from_slice(input);
    buf
}

pub fn get_provides_bitset(
    result: &BinaryExecutionResult,
    payload: &[u8],
) -> Result<BitVec, IpcError> {
    // SAFETY: packed struct fields must be read with read_unaligned to avoid
    // undefined behavior from misaligned access.
    let count = unsafe {
        std::ptr::addr_of!(result.provides_words_count).read_unaligned()
    } as usize;
    let offset = unsafe {
        std::ptr::addr_of!(result.provides_words_offset).read_unaligned()
    } as usize;

    let mut bits = BitVec::with_capacity(count * 64);
    for i in 0..count {
        let start = offset + i * 8;
        let word = u64::from_le_bytes(
            payload[start..start + 8].try_into().map_err(|_| IpcError::BufferTooSmall)?
        );
        for bit in 0..64 { bits.push((word >> bit) & 1 == 1); }
    }
    Ok(bits)
}
```

### Rules

1. **Always use `#[repr(C, packed)]`** for structs that cross the Extism boundary.
2. **Always encode/decode explicitly** with `to_le_bytes()` / `from_le_bytes()`. Never `transmute`.
3. **Validate magic and version** before reading any other field.
4. **Offsets are absolute from buffer start**, never relative to struct end.
5. **Variable-length data** is appended after the fixed header. The header contains `offset` and `len` fields.
6. **Use `read_unaligned`** for packed struct field access — this is the only required `unsafe`.

### When to avoid

- **Internal structs that never cross a boundary:** `#[repr(C, packed)]` prevents optimizations.
- **Human-readable protocols:** Use JSON or text.
- **When the schema changes frequently:** Use Protocol Buffers or FlatBuffers.

---

## 8. Pattern 6 — Scoped Ownership (Replacing Arenas)

**What problem this solves.** If you come from C++, you may reach for an arena
allocator or a "reusable buffer" to avoid repeated malloc/free in batch
processing. If you come from Go or Python, you rarely think about this at all
— and your programs pay for it. Rust's ownership model already gives you the
arena for free: local `Vec`s and `String`s are dropped at scope exit by RAII.
Trust the stack; only pre-allocate when profiling proves allocation is the
bottleneck.

### The problem

Rust has no built-in arena allocator (and `bumpalo` is forbidden by project policy). Intermediate allocations are scoped to logical units of work via RAII ownership.

### The Rust solution

**Trust the stack and `Drop`.** Ownership scopes naturally replicate the arena pattern. All intermediate `Vec`s and `String`s owned by local variables are dropped at scope exit.

### Per-request scoping

```rust
async fn handle_request(&self, raw_json: &str) -> Result<String, McpError> {
    let req: JsonRpcRequest = serde_json::from_str(raw_json)?;
    let result = self.reactor.route(&req.query).await?;
    // `req` and all intermediates are dropped at end of scope
    Ok(serde_json::to_string(&result)?)
}
```

### Batch processing

```rust
{
    let mut mapper = TripleMapper::new(&library, &config);
    mapper.process_triples(triples)?;
    mapper.flush()?;  // escaped data cloned into library
}  // all locals dropped automatically
```

### Rules

- **Do not pre-allocate reusable buffers** unless profiling proves allocation is a bottleneck.
- **If you want an arena, use a scoped function** with local `Vec`s.
- **Builder ownership transfer:** `build()` consumes the builder and returns an owned struct.

---

## 9. Pattern 7 — Newtype Handles (Typed Opaque IDs)

**What problem this solves.** In Python, `NodeId` and `SessionId` are both
`int` — passing one where the other is expected compiles, runs, and crashes
later. Go has the same weakness with aliased types. C++ typedefs too. A Rust
*newtype* wraps the integer in a distinct type so the compiler rejects the mix
at every call site — the same zero-cost representation, with a different,
non-interchangeable type.

### The problem

```python
NodeId = int
SessionId = int
process_node(session_id)  # Accepted silently — crashes later
```

### The Rust solution

Newtype wrappers create distinct types that share the integer representation. The compiler rejects mixing `NodeId` with `SessionId` at every call site.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct NodeId(pub i64);

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct SessionId(pub i64);

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct TargetId(pub i64);

impl NodeId {
    pub fn from_int(i: i64) -> Self { Self(i) }
    pub fn as_int(self) -> i64 { self.0 }
}
```

```rust
fn process_node(id: NodeId) { ... }

let node = NodeId::from_int(42);
let sess = SessionId::from_int(42);
process_node(node);  // OK
process_node(sess);  // Compile error: expected NodeId, found SessionId
```

### Rules

- **Use for any integer ID that crosses module boundaries** and must not be mixed with other IDs.
- **Do NOT use when you need arithmetic on the ID.** Use a raw integer for counters.
- **Derive `Serialize, Deserialize`** so the newtype is transparent in JSON/DB.

---

## 10. Pattern 8 — Unit of Work (Orchestration Interface)

**What problem this solves.** An orchestrator (a DAG executor, an MCP server,
a WASM host) must run *heterogeneous* tasks uniformly. Without a common
interface, the orchestrator ends up with a `match` on every task type — the
branching that C++ hides in vtables and Python does implicitly. This pattern
is the single interface (`WorkUnit`) every task presents, so the orchestrator
iterates a `Vec<Arc<dyn Component>>` and calls `.execute()` with no `match`.
It is the pattern on which the whole crate rests.

### The problem

An orchestrator (DAG executor, MCP server, WASM plugin host) must execute heterogeneous tasks uniformly. Without a common interface, the orchestrator branches on implementation type.

### Definition

`WorkUnit`, `WorkContext`, `WorkOutput`, and `WorkError` live in
`fluent-wvr/src/work.rs` and `fluent-wvr/src/traits.rs`. The full
shapes are listed in §2. The unit-of-work pattern itself is short:

```rust
pub trait WorkUnit: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn depends(&self) -> &[ArcIntern<str>];
    fn provides(&self) -> &[ArcIntern<str>];
    fn execute(&self, ctx: &WorkContext) -> Result<WorkOutput, WorkError>;
    fn default_timeout_ms(&self) -> u64 { 30_000 }
    fn type_name(&self) -> &'static str { std::any::type_name::<Self>() }
}
```

### Implementation: native command

`CommandUnit` in `dag/src/work_unit.rs`. Note that `WorkContext` does
**not** carry a `library` or `input` field — those belong in
component-specific configuration or in the `data` payload of
`WorkOutput`. `WorkError` does not have `ExecutionFailed` or
`WasmFailed` variants; the only variants are `Execution(String)`,
`Dependency(String)`, and `Timeout { duration_ms, unit }`.

```rust
use bon::Builder;
#[derive(Builder)]
#[builder(start_fn = new)]
pub struct CommandUnit {
    name: String,
    command: String,
    #[builder(default)]
    depends: Vec<ArcIntern<str>>,
    #[builder(default)]
    provides: Vec<ArcIntern<str>>,
}

impl WorkUnit for CommandUnit {
    fn name(&self) -> &str { &self.name }
    fn depends(&self) -> &[ArcIntern<str>] { &self.depends }
    fn provides(&self) -> &[ArcIntern<str>] { &self.provides }

                "[DRY-RUN] would execute: {}", self.command
            )));
        }
        if self.command.is_empty() {
            return Ok(WorkOutput::ok(format!("no-op: {}", self.name)));
        }

### Implementation: WASM plugin bridge

The real `WasmComponent` (in `coral/src/wasm_runtime.rs`) uses field
construction, not a `new(plugin, schema)` constructor. `WasmComponent`
also implements `Component` via `impl_component!` (not via a blanket
impl — there is no blanket impl).

```rust
pub struct WasmComponent {
    name: ArcIntern<str>,
    plugin: Mutex<extism::Plugin>,
    config: Mutex<HashMap<String, String>>,
    schema: serde_json::Value,            // loaded from plugin at init time
    depends: Vec<ArcIntern<str>>,
    provides: Vec<ArcIntern<str>>,
}

impl WorkUnit for WasmComponent {
    fn name(&self) -> &str { &self.name }
    fn depends(&self) -> &[ArcIntern<str>] { &self.depends }
    fn provides(&self) -> &[ArcIntern<str>] { &self.provides }

    fn execute(&self, ctx: &WorkContext) -> Result<WorkOutput, WorkError> {
        // Inputs flow through the `data` payload of `WorkOutput` or
        // through a side-channel like `ctx.metadata`, not `ctx.input`.
        let mut plugin = self.plugin.lock().unwrap();
        let payload = ctx.metadata.get("input")
            .and_then(|v| v.as_str().map(String::as_bytes))
            .unwrap_or(&[]);
        let result = plugin.call("execute", payload)
            .map_err(|e| WorkError::Execution(e.to_string()))?;
        Ok(decode_output(&result)?)
    }
}

impl FieldAccess for WasmComponent {
    fn set_field(&mut self, name: &str, value: &str) -> Result<(), FieldError> {
        let mut plugin = self.plugin.lock().unwrap();
        plugin.call("set_config", format!("{}={}", name, value).as_bytes())
            .map_err(|e| FieldError::Parse(
                format!("wasm set_config failed for '{}': {}", name, e)
            ))?;
        self.config.lock().unwrap().insert(name.to_string(), value.to_string());
        Ok(())
    }
    fn get_field(&self, name: &str) -> Result<String, FieldError> {
        self.config.lock().unwrap().get(name).cloned()
            .ok_or_else(|| FieldError::NotFound(name.into()))
    }
    fn field_names(&self) -> &'static [&'static str] { &[] }   // schema is dynamic
}

impl Describable for WasmComponent {
    fn describe(&self) -> serde_json::Value { self.schema.clone() }
}
impl_component!(WasmComponent);
```

### Implementation: database work-unit (`fluent-db::wvr::DbWorkUnit`)

Synchronous database operations are not natively schedulable as `WorkUnit`s:
`execute` MUST NOT block a tokio worker thread. `fluent-db` (the canonical
database-access crate, `src/db/`) solves this with the `DbWorkUnit<F>`
adapter — a `Component`/`WorkUnit` whose `execute` offloads the blocking
rusqlite op off the executor via `tokio::task::block_in_place` (on a
multi-thread runtime worker) or runs it directly (otherwise). It composes the
`fluent-db` store shapes rather than touching a `Connection` itself:

```rust
use fluent_db::wvr::store_unit;
use fluent_db::store::SqliteStore;
use fluent_wvr::prelude::*;

let store: Arc<SqliteStore> = Arc::new(SqliteStore::open(path)?);

// `store_unit` wraps a `Fn(&Connection) -> Result<WorkOutput, DbError>` op;
// `execute` offloads it and maps `DbError` → `WorkError::Execution`.
let unit: Arc<dyn Component> = Arc::new(Instrumented::new(
    store_unit(
        store,
        "db.sync",
        |conn| {
            let n = fluent_db::query::execute(conn, "UPDATE t SET seen = 1", [])?;
            Ok(WorkOutput::ok_with_data("synced", serde_json::json!({ "rows": n })))
        },
    ),
    "db.sync",
));
```

`DbWorkUnit::builder()` (bon-style: `.name()`, `.op(...)`, `.depends()`,
`.provides()`, `.default_timeout_ms()`) is the fully general form for ops that
need to read `&WorkContext` or return arbitrary `WorkOutput`. Because the op
runs on a blocking thread, the unit can be registered under a `SupervisedBatch` for
timeout/retry/dependency-cancellation without violating the purity contract —
the `SupervisedBatch`'s per-attempt budget applies to the offloaded task, and the
executor is never starved. `execute` scopes `ctx.caps` into the `CURRENT_CAPS`
task-local on **both** offload paths (`block_in_place` and the scoped-thread
path), so a pool-backed op that calls `SqlitePool::acquire`/`with_conn` (both
capability-gated) works under a `SupervisedBatch`-style context on multi-thread and
current-thread runtimes alike.

### Orchestration — uniform loop

The orchestrator sees a single `Arc<dyn Component>` handle regardless
of origin. The two key traits at the registration site are `impl_component!`
(to satisfy the supertrait) and the prelude import.

```rust
use fluent_wvr::prelude::*;

let mut registry: Vec<Arc<dyn Component>> = Vec::new();
registry.push(Arc::new(Instrumented::new(
    CommandUnit { /* … */ },
    "build",
)));
registry.push(Arc::new(WasmComponent { /* … */ }));

// The orchestrator sees one interface regardless of origin:
for unit in &registry {
    let output = unit.execute(&ctx)?;
    if !output.success { /* … */ }
}
```

### Rules

- **Every orchestratable task implements `WorkUnit`.** No exceptions.
- **Store as `Arc<dyn WorkUnit>` or `Arc<dyn Component>`** in registries.
- **Do NOT add methods to `WorkUnit` speculatively.** Start with `name`, `depends`, `provides`, `execute`. Add `default_timeout_ms`/`type_name` overrides only when the second implementation requires it (both have sensible defaults).
- **For full runtime configurability**, implement all three sub-traits and call `impl_component!` to satisfy the `Component` supertrait.
- **`execute` MUST be synchronous and non-blocking.** See the purity contract in the `WorkUnit` doc comment — violations defeat the `SupervisedBatch` timeout/retry invariants.

## 11. Pattern 9 — Middleware Chain (Post-Erasure Cross-Cutting)

**What problem this solves.** Pattern 3 (newtype wrappers) can only add
cross-cutting concerns *before* the type is erased to `Arc<dyn Component>` —
that is the one point where the compiler can inline. Once a unit is in the
registry, you can no longer wrap it generically. This pattern is the
post-erasure answer: a `Middleware` takes an `Arc<dyn Component>` and returns a
wrapped one. If you know Go's middleware-in-a-server idiom (`next(w, r)`), it
is the same shape; C++ analog is the chain-of-responsibility; Python analog is
a decorator applied after the fact.

### The problem

When you already have `Arc<dyn WorkUnit>` and need to add logging, retry, or rate limiting, you cannot use newtype wrappers (Pattern 3) because the type is erased. You need post-erasure composition.

### Definition

The `Middleware` trait and `MiddlewareChain` live in
`fluent-wvr/src/wrapper.rs` (the canonical home); `dag/src/middleware.rs`
implements `TimingMiddleware` on top of them. The trait is the minimal
post-erasure seam:

```rust
pub trait Middleware: Send + Sync {
    fn wrap(&self, inner: Arc<dyn Component>) -> Arc<dyn Component>;
}

pub struct TimingMiddleware {
    histogram: Option<Arc<LatencyHistogram>>,
}

impl Middleware for TimingMiddleware {
    fn wrap(&self, inner: Arc<dyn Component>) -> Arc<dyn Component> {
        match &self.histogram {
            // The actual implementation reuses `Instrumented::with_metrics`
            // from fluent-wvr — no parallel `InstrumentedWorkUnit` struct.
            Some(hist) => Arc::new(Instrumented::with_metrics(
                inner, "middleware", Arc::clone(hist),
            )),
            None => Arc::new(Instrumented::new(inner, "middleware")),
        }
    }
}
```

The middleware crate does **not** redefine its own wrapper types — it
composes the canonical ones. The actual
`TimingMiddleware::with_histogram(histogram)` constructor takes an
`Arc<LatencyHistogram>`; without one, it produces an `Instrumented`
that logs via `tracing::info!` only.

### Stacking middleware

```rust
let unit: Arc<dyn Component> = Arc::new(CommandUnit { ... });

let chain: MiddlewareChain = MiddlewareChain::new()
    .push(Box::new(TimingMiddleware::new()));

let wrapped = chain.apply(unit);
```

`MiddlewareChain::apply` folds the unit through each layer:
`result = unit; for mw in &middlewares { result = mw.wrap(result); }`.

### Rules

- **Prefer newtype wrappers (Pattern 3) when the type is not yet erased.** Middleware adds a vtable call layer; wrappers can be inlined.
- **Use `Arc<dyn Component>`**, not `Box`, because middleware may be shared across threads.
- **Apply middleware at registration time**, not at execution time.
- **Each middleware layer adds one vtable dispatch.** Minimize layers on hot paths.
- **Reuse `Instrumented` from fluent-wvr.** Do not define parallel wrapper types inside `dag` — the whole point of fluent-wvr is the single source of truth.

### Sequential step chains: `Pipeline<'a, T, E>`

`Pipeline` (in `fluent-wvr/src/wrapper.rs`, re-exported by the prelude) is the
composition helper for a **sequential, fallible step chain over one mutable
value** — the middleware/cascade analog for plain `&mut T` processing rather
than `Arc<dyn Component>`. Steps run in registration order; optional steps are
gated by a predicate and skipped when it returns `false`.

```rust
use fluent_wvr::wrapper::Pipeline;

let mut pipeline = Pipeline::new()
    .step(|cfg: &mut Config| -> Result<(), ConfigError> { cfg.validate()?; Ok(()) })
    .maybe(
        |cfg| cfg.env == "prod",
        |cfg| -> Result<(), ConfigError> { cfg.enforce_tls()?; Ok(()) },
    );

let mut cfg = Config::default();
pipeline.run(&mut cfg)?;   // required step always runs; prod-only step gated
```

Use `Pipeline` when a config/handshake/request goes through an ordered series
of fallible transformations with optional stages. Use `MiddlewareChain` for
post-erasure `Arc<dyn Component>` wrapping, and `ComponentCascade` (Pattern 10)
for first-Ok-wins dispatch.


---

## 12. Pattern 10 — Component Adapter (Runtime Type Adaptation)

**What problem this solves.** Sometimes the adaptation decision — renaming a
component, swapping its behavior, overriding a field — is made at *runtime*,
not at compile time. A newtype wrapper (Pattern 3) cannot do this: it is fixed
at compile time. This pattern wraps an existing `Arc<dyn Component>` and lets
you layer overrides (`name`, `execute`, fields) without modifying the original
type — the runtime analog of Go's embedded struct that overrides a method, or
C++'s decorator.

### The problem

When adaptation decisions are made at runtime — renaming a component, overriding its execution behavior, or bridging between interfaces — you cannot use compile-time generics.

### Definition in `fluent-wvr/src/wrapper.rs`

`ComponentAdapter` wraps any `Arc<dyn Component>` and lets callers
override `name`, `execute`, and field values at runtime. The
overrides stack — calling `with_field_override` twice with the same
key keeps the most recently set value.

```rust
/// Type alias used by `with_execute_override`. The closure must be
/// `Send + Sync + 'static` because the adapter is shared across threads.
pub type ExecuteFn =
    Arc<dyn Fn(&WorkContext) -> Result<WorkOutput, WorkError> + Send + Sync>;

pub struct ComponentAdapter {
    inner: Arc<dyn Component>,
    name_override: Option<String>,
    execute_override: Option<ExecuteFn>,
    field_overrides: HashMap<String, String>,
}

impl ComponentAdapter {
    pub fn new(inner: Arc<dyn Component>) -> Self { /* all None */ }

    /// Rename the component. `WorkUnit::name()` returns this when set.
    #[must_use]
    pub fn with_name_override(mut self, name: impl Into<String>) -> Self;

    /// Replace `execute` with a custom handler — useful for test
    /// doubles, memoised fast paths, or policy enforcement layers.
    /// Pass an `Arc::new(|ctx| ...)` (not a bare closure).
    #[must_use]
    pub fn with_execute_override(mut self, f: ExecuteFn) -> Self;

    /// Add one field override. Re-setting the same key keeps the new value.
    #[must_use]
    pub fn with_field_override(self, name: impl Into<String>, value: impl Into<String>) -> Self;

    /// Bulk-set from a `HashMap`. Existing keys are replaced.
    #[must_use]
    pub fn with_field_overrides(mut self, overrides: HashMap<String, String>) -> Self;

    /// Drop all field overrides. After this call, `get_field` falls
    /// through to `self.inner`.
    pub fn clear_field_overrides(&mut self);

    /// Borrow the wrapped component.
    pub fn inner(&self) -> &Arc<dyn Component>;
}
```

`ComponentAdapter` must implement all three sub-traits to remain a
`Component`. Note the `set_field` semantics: it propagates the inner
error when the inner has the field but rejects it, and it stores the
override only after the inner accepts the value.

```rust
impl FieldAccess for ComponentAdapter {
    fn set_field(&mut self, name: &str, value: &str) -> Result<(), FieldError> {
        if let Some(inner) = Arc::get_mut(&mut self.inner) {
            inner.set_field(name, value)?;   // inner validates; on Err, the
                                              // override below is NOT stored
        }
        self.field_overrides.insert(name.into(), value.into());
        Ok(())
    }
    fn get_field(&self, name: &str) -> Result<String, FieldError> {
        if let Some(v) = self.field_overrides.get(name) {
            return Ok(v.clone());
        }
        self.inner.get_field(name)
    }
    fn field_names(&self) -> &'static [&'static str] {
        self.inner.field_names()      // never returns the override set
    }
}

impl Describable for ComponentAdapter {
    fn describe(&self) -> serde_json::Value {
        let mut schema = self.inner.describe();
        if let Some(name) = &self.name_override {
            schema["name"] = serde_json::Value::String(name.clone());
        }
        if !self.field_overrides.is_empty() {
            let mut pairs: Vec<(&String, &String)> =
                self.field_overrides.iter().collect();
            pairs.sort_by(|a, b| a.0.cmp(b.0));
            schema["field_overrides"] = serde_json::json!(
                pairs.into_iter()
                     .map(|(k, v)| vec![k.clone(), v.clone()])
                     .collect::<Vec<_>>()
            );
        }
        schema["adapted"] = serde_json::Value::Bool(true);
        schema
    }
}

impl WorkUnit for ComponentAdapter {
    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        self.name_override.as_deref()
            .unwrap_or_else(|| self.inner.name())
    }
    fn depends(&self) -> &[ArcIntern<str>] { self.inner.depends() }
    fn provides(&self) -> &[ArcIntern<str>] { self.inner.provides() }

    fn execute(&self, ctx: &WorkContext) -> Result<WorkOutput, WorkError> {
        match &self.execute_override {
            Some(f) => f(ctx),
            None    => self.inner.execute(ctx),
        }
    }
}
impl_component!(ComponentAdapter);   // <-- required, not a blanket impl
```

### Usage: adapting a WASM plugin

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use fluent_wvr::prelude::*;

let wasm_unit: Arc<dyn Component> = Arc::new(WasmComponent { /* … */ });

let adapted = Arc::new(
    ComponentAdapter::new(wasm_unit)
        .with_name_override("custom_name")
        .with_execute_override(Arc::new(|_ctx| {
            Ok(WorkOutput::ok("overridden by adapter"))
        }))
        .with_field_override("port", "8080"),
);

registry.push(adapted);
```

### Rules

- **Use when adaptation decisions are made at runtime.** For compile-time adaptation, use newtype wrappers.
- **Adapters implement `Component`** via `impl_component!(ComponentAdapter)`, so they store in the same registry as any other component.
- **Delegate to the inner component** for all methods you don't override — `depends`, `provides`, `field_names`, and `get_field` (when no override is set) all fall through.
- **`set_field` validates against the inner first, then stores.** If `Arc::get_mut(&mut self.inner)` returns `None`, the override is stored silently — the inner sees the value on the next call only if the inner has interior mutability. If the inner rejects the value, the override is *not* stored.
- **`get_field` falls back to the inner component** when no override exists for the requested field.

### ComponentCascade — first-Ok-wins fallback cascade

`ComponentCascade` (`fluent_wvr::wrapper`, in the prelude) is the shared
first-Ok-wins primitive: a sequence of `Arc<dyn Component>` units whose
`execute_first_ok` runs each in order and returns the first `Ok(WorkOutput)`.
An `Err`/`WorkOutput::fail` moves to the next unit; exhaustion returns the
last error (empty cascade → `Err(WorkError::Execution("component cascade has
no units"))`). It is itself a `Component` via `impl_component!`.

```rust
let cascade = ComponentCascade::with_units(vec![
    Arc::new(l1_unit),
    Arc::new(l2_unit),
]);
let output = cascade.execute_first_ok(&ctx)?;  // first Ok short-circuits
```

Canonical consumer: coral's `TierRegistry` (L1/L2/L3/L4 tier dispatch)
delegates to a cascade; its `knn_k` / `l4_threshold` / `l3_max_depth`
config and name overrides stay coral-side state that *feeds* the cascade.

> **Error-boilerplate macro:** `common_core::error::impl_from_io_error!`
> (re-exported as `common_core::impl_from_io_error!`) writes the
> `impl From<std::io::Error> for T { fn from(e) -> Self { Self::Io(IoError(e)) } }`
> hop for enums that already carry an `Io(#[from] IoError)` variant. Use it
> instead of hand-copying the wrapper.

## 13. Runtime Composition: The Full Lifecycle

**What this section does.** Every pattern so far produces or consumes one
`Arc<dyn Component>`. This section walks a single component through the *whole
lifecycle* — build → configure → wrap → execute → inspect — to show that the
origin (Rust struct, WASM plugin, database config) is irrelevant: the caller
sees the same six operations through the same handle. If you are new to the
crate, this is the section to read after §2: it is Patterns 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10
composed end-to-end.

This section demonstrates how all twelve patterns compose into a single workflow. Each step uses the same `Arc<dyn Component>` handle.

### Compile-time assembly (Rust struct)

```rust
// 1. Build: fluent builder collects arguments
let mut component = ToolConfig::builder()
    .port(8080)
    .host("localhost".into())
    .verbose(false)
    .build()?;

// 2. Configure: set fields by name before sharing
component.set_field("port", "9000")?;
component.set_field("verbose", "true")?;

// 3. Wrap: add cross-cutting concerns before type erasure (inlineable)
// (retry composes `common_core::retry` or the `SupervisedBatch` supervisor instead —
// see the Retry section in Pattern 3)
let wrapped = Instrumented::new(component, "my_tool");

// 4. Erase to Arc<dyn Component>: uniform handle from this point on
let handle: Arc<dyn Component> = Arc::new(wrapped);
registry.push(handle.clone());

// 5. Execute uniformly
let output = handle.execute(&ctx)?;

// 6. Inspect: read fields through the trait object
let port = handle.get_field("port")?;

// 7. Describe: generate JSON Schema through the trait object
let schema = handle.describe();
```

### Runtime assembly (WASM plugin)

```rust
// 1. Load plugin and extract schema from the plugin itself
let plugin = extism::Plugin::new(wasm_bytes)?;
let schema_bytes = plugin.call("get_schema", &[])?;
let schema: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_slice(&schema_bytes)?;

// 2. Bridge into Component interface (field construction — no `new` constructor)
let mut wasm_comp = WasmComponent {
    name: ArcIntern::from("my_tool"),
    plugin: Mutex::new(plugin),
    config: Mutex::new(HashMap::new()),
    schema,
    depends: vec![],
    provides: vec![],
};

// 3. Configure by name (delegates into the WASM plugin)
// Note: WasmComponent uses interior mutability, so this works on &mut self
wasm_comp.set_field("timeout_ms", "5000")?;

// 4. Erase to Arc<dyn Component>: same uniform handle as the Rust struct case
let handle: Arc<dyn Component> = Arc::new(wasm_comp);

// 5-7: execute, inspect, describe — identical call sites
let output = handle.execute(&ctx)?;
let schema = handle.describe();
```

### Runtime assembly (database-driven config)

```rust
use fluent_wvr::DynamicComponent;

// 1. Load config from database
let rows = db.query("SELECT key, value FROM tool_config WHERE tool_id = ?", &[tool_id])?;
let config: HashMap<String, String> = rows.into_iter()
    .map(|r| (r.get::<_, String>("key"), r.get::<_, String>("value")))
    .collect();

// 2. Inject the executable body (the "tool") as a closure
let executor: DynamicExecutor = Arc::new(|_ctx, config| {
    let retries = config.get("retries").cloned().unwrap_or_default();
    Ok(WorkOutput::ok_with_data(
        format!("configured retries={retries}"),
        serde_json::json!({ "retries": retries }),
    ))
});

// 3. Assemble + configure by name
let mut dyn_comp = DynamicComponent::new("db.tool", executor)
    .with_field_keys(&["retries", "timeout_ms"])
    .with_config(config);
dyn_comp.set_field("retries", "3")?;

// 4. Erase to Arc<dyn Component>: same uniform handle
let handle: Arc<dyn Component> = Arc::new(dyn_comp);
let output = handle.execute(&ctx)?;
```

> **Status: compatibility surface (scaffold).** `DynamicComponent` is the
> forward-compat seam for runtime-assembled configuration. It has no
> production consumer in-tree today; its purpose is to keep the `Component`
> interface uniformly available to DB-config units without branching on
> origin. Keep it as designed — do not prune it as dead code.

### Key guarantee

In all three cases — Rust struct, WASM plugin, database config — the orchestrator sees the same six operations through the same `Arc<dyn Component>` handle: `execute`, `get_field`, `set_field`, `field_names`, `describe`, and `as_any` (for runtime downcasting). No branching on origin.

---

## 14. Pattern 11 — Structured Logging Context

**What problem this solves.** In a multi-threaded server, log lines from
different requests interleave; correlating them with a request is hard. Python
uses thread-local context vars, Go uses `context.Context` threading, C++ uses
a thread-local or a manually-passed logger. This crate deliberately does **not**
invent a context-logger; it composes `Instrumented` (per-unit timing logs) with
a lock-free `LatencyHistogram` — observability without a new global.

### The problem

In a multi-threaded server, log messages from different requests interleave. Without request context, correlating log lines with a specific request is difficult.

### Canonical implementation

The codebase does **not** implement a standalone `LogContext` / `Scope` / `call_logged`
module. Instead, timing and observability are handled by two composable primitives:

1. **`fluent_wvr::wrapper::Instrumented<U>`** — wraps any `WorkUnit` and logs
   execution duration via `tracing::info!` on every `execute` call. Optionally
   records into a `LatencyHistogram` when constructed with `with_metrics`.

2. **`common_core::metrics::LatencyHistogram`** — a lock-free, atomic
   histogram with bucket-based approximation. Supports `observe(duration_ms)`,
   `observe_duration(start)`, and `estimate_percentile(pct)`.

### Usage

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use common_core::LatencyHistogram;
use fluent_wvr::wrapper::Instrumented;

// Basic instrumentation (tracing only):
let unit = Instrumented::new(my_component, "ingest_yago");

// With metrics (tracing + histogram):
let histogram = Arc::new(LatencyHistogram::new());
let unit = Instrumented::with_metrics(my_component, "ingest_yago", histogram.clone());

// After execution, query the histogram:
let p50 = histogram.estimate_percentile(50.0);
let p99 = histogram.estimate_percentile(99.0);
println!("p50={p50}ms p99={p99}ms total={}ms", histogram.sum_ms());
```

**Production consumer:** The `with_metrics` wrapper is wired into
three sites in the workspace:

1. `coral/src/cache/reactor.rs:22-28` — Coral's `QueueReactor` (the module
   moved from `cache_reactor.rs` to `cache/reactor.rs`) wraps each cache tier
   (`L2WasmUnit`, `L3GraphUnit`, `L4SemanticUnit`, `L5FrontierUnit`) in
   `Instrumented::with_metrics(adapted, label, hist)` via the shared
   `wrap_tier` helper before erasing to `Arc<dyn Component>`. The histograms
   are exposed via the `coral_stats` MCP method, returning aggregated
   p50/p99/count/sum per tier.

2. `dag/src/middleware.rs:34` — `TimingMiddleware` wraps an
   `Arc<dyn Component>` in `Instrumented::with_metrics` when a histogram
   is provided, falling back to `Instrumented::new` otherwise.

3. `router/src/charts/execute.rs:231` — the chart-DAG executor wraps every
   compiled workflow target in `Instrumented::with_metrics` before erasure,
   so workflow-execution latency lands in a shared `LatencyHistogram`.

A consumer test that exercises the histogram path end-to-end lives in
`wrapper.rs:783-800` (`instrumented_with_metrics_records_duration`).

### Key properties

1. **Thread-safe:** `LatencyHistogram` uses `AtomicU64` counters — no locks.
2. **Zero overhead when unused:** `histogram: None` skips the observe call.
3. **Composable:** `Instrumented` wraps before type erasure (Pattern 3), preserving inlining.

### Rules

- **Use `Instrumented` for per-unit timing.** It logs via `tracing` and optionally records to a histogram.
- **Use `LatencyHistogram` for aggregate latency stats.** Expose via `--debug` or a telemetry command.
- **Do NOT hand-roll `Instant::now()` + `elapsed()` + `info!`** when `Instrumented` can do it.

## 15. Pattern Synergies

**What this section does.** The patterns above are individually useful but
their real power is combination: each produces something another consumes
(Builder → owned struct → wrapped → erased → orchestrated → adapted). Read
this as the "how it all fits together" map — if you understand the arrows, you
understand the crate.

The patterns are not independently beneficial — their value multiplies when composed. Each pattern produces something another consumes.

| Pattern | Produces | Consumed by |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Fluent Builder | Fully-configured owned object | Trait Composition (wrap before erasure) |
| Trait-Based Reflection | `FieldAccess` + `Describable` | `Component` supertrait (via `impl_component!`) |
| Trait Composition | Instrumented concrete type | Trait Object (erase after wrapping) |
| Trait Objects | `Arc<dyn Component>` uniform handle | Middleware Chain, Component Adapter, registry |
| Scoped Ownership | RAII-managed intermediates | Binary IPC payload lifetime |
| Newtype Handles | Distinct integer types | Trait Object registries (prevent ID confusion) |
| Unit of Work | `WorkUnit` impl | `Component` supertrait (via `impl_component!`), registry |
| Middleware Chain | Wrapped `Arc<dyn WorkUnit>` | Registry, orchestrator |
| Component Adapter | Runtime-adapted `Arc<dyn Component>` | Registry, orchestrator |
| Structured Logging Context | Request-scoped observability | All handler entry points |
| Cache Tier WorkUnit | Per-tier `Arc<dyn Component>` (`L4SemanticUnit`, etc.) | `TierRegistry`, `QueueReactor` |

### Key synergies

**Builder + Trait Object** eliminates per-call type branching. Builder accumulation is lock-free; only registry insertion requires synchronization. The orchestrator iterates `Arc<dyn WorkUnit>` and calls `.execute()` without any `match`.

**Trait-Based Reflection + Describable** makes the struct definition the single source of truth. `#[derive(FieldAccess, Describable)]` generates field access, validation, and JSON Schema from one definition. A new field automatically appears in the accessor, the validator, and the schema — one edit, one file.

**Trait Composition + Trait Objects** gives zero-modification observability. Wrap before erasure; the wrapper is inlined by the compiler. The orchestrator gets instrumented execution without any business logic change.

**Scoped Ownership + Binary IPC** eliminates payload lifetime management. `encode_request` returns an owned `Vec<u8>`; the call takes a byte slice; the `Vec` is dropped after the call. No individual allocation to track.

**Component Adapter + Middleware** enables runtime orchestration policies. An adapter can change execution behavior; middleware can add retry or rate limiting. The orchestrator composes both dynamically without recompilation.

### Promotion candidates (canonical homes — compose, don't copy)

These consumer-side patterns are genuine control-plane references with a
single consumer today. They stay in place until a second consumer appears —
at which point the *next* consumer must adopt the canonical home below
rather than copy the consumer copy.

| Pattern (current home) | Canonical home when promoted |
|---|---|
| `SearchBackend` + `Formatter` intent-dispatch control plane (`src/guidance/src/query/search_backend.rs:22-33`) — each backend matches one `QueryIntent` and the orchestrator iterates `matches` + `search` without branching on implementation | pattern reference, not code — this is Pattern 4 (Trait Objects) + Pattern 8 (Unit of Work) composed; reuse the pattern, promote a concrete trait only when a second consumer exists |

---

## 16. Anti-Patterns

**What this section does.** Each anti-pattern is a *seductive wrong answer* —
the thing a programmer new to Rust naturally reaches for (raw pointers for
vtables, hand-rolled builders, a `match`-based orchestrator, `transmute` for
IPC) and the correct pattern that replaces it. If you are reviewing code, scan
this list for the ❌ markers; if you are writing code, the ✅/Right alternatives
are the canonical shapes.

### ❌ Manual builder structs

```rust
// Wrong: 50+ lines of boilerplate
pub struct TargetBuilder { name: Option<String>, depends: Option<BitVec>, ... }
impl TargetBuilder {
    pub fn name(mut self, name: String) -> Self { self.name = Some(name); self }
    // ...
}

// Right
#[derive(bon::Builder)]
pub struct Target { ... }
```

### ❌ Raw-pointer vtables for compile-time-known types

```rust
// Wrong: bypasses borrow checker, requires manual Box::from_raw cleanup
pub struct WvrHandle { pub ptr: *mut (), pub vtable: &'static WvrVTable }

// Right: compiler generates the vtable, Arc manages cleanup
let unit: Arc<dyn Component> = Arc::new(MyComponent::new());
```

### ✅ Manual vtable bridges for runtime-assembled interfaces (legitimate use case)

When some methods come from a compiled struct and others from a WASM plugin, bridge through a struct that implements `Component` — not through raw pointers:

```rust
// Right: bridge struct implements the full Component interface
pub struct WasmComponent { plugin: Mutex<extism::Plugin>, schema: serde_json::Value, ... }
impl WorkUnit for WasmComponent { ... }
impl FieldAccess for WasmComponent { ... }
impl Describable for WasmComponent { ... }
impl_component!(WasmComponent);   // <-- required; there is no blanket impl
```

### ❌ Hand-rolling `as_any`/`as_any_mut`

The `Component` supertrait requires the two `Any` methods. The
7-line body is identical for every type:

```rust
// Wrong: boilerplate at every implementation site
impl Component for MyType {
    fn as_any(&self) -> &dyn Any { self }
    fn as_any_mut(&mut self) -> &mut dyn Any { self }
}

// Right: one line restores the "blanket-impl feel"
impl_component!(MyType);

// And for wrapper types:
impl_component!(generic (U: Component + 'static) for Instrumented<U>);
```

There is **no blanket `impl<T: FieldAccess + Describable + WorkUnit +
Send + Sync> Component for T`**. The blanket impl is unsound because it
collides with `impl Component for Arc<dyn Component>` (every trait
object would then be a `Component` twice). The `impl_component!` macro
is the canonical mechanism; if a second consumer materializes that
needs a different style, the macro is the extension point.

### ❌ Parallel trait hierarchies

Do not invent a second `as_any`/`as_any_mut` pair (or any second
`Component`-shaped trait) inside a sub-crate. This is what
`guidance-content-node` does today — its `ContentNode` trait
(`node.rs:28-39`) duplicates the `Component` supertrait surface. New
code should either (a) depend on `fluent-wvr` and implement
`Component` directly, or (b) extend `ContentNode` only when the
content-specific methods cannot be expressed on `Component`.

### ❌ `dyn Trait` with only one implementation

```rust
// Wrong: vtable dispatch for a single type
let provider: Arc<dyn EmbeddingProvider> = Arc::new(NoopEmbedding::new(768));

// Right
let provider = NoopEmbedding::new(768);
```

### ❌ Speculative traits

```rust
// Wrong: trait for one implementation with no second planned
pub trait DataStore: Send + Sync { ... }
pub struct SqliteStore;
impl DataStore for SqliteStore { ... }

// Right: use the concrete type; add the trait when the second implementation arrives
pub struct SqliteStore;
impl SqliteStore { ... }
```

### ❌ Cosmopolitan Polymorphism (identical execute bodies)

```rust
// Wrong: three impls routing to the same function
impl WorkUnit for IdentifierQuery {
    fn execute(&self, ctx: &WorkContext) -> Result<WorkOutput, WorkError> {
        run_staged_query(ctx, &self.config)  // same body
    }
}
impl WorkUnit for CapabilityQuery {
    fn execute(&self, ctx: &WorkContext) -> Result<WorkOutput, WorkError> {
        run_staged_query(ctx, &self.config)  // same body
    }
}

// Right: use a function pointer for the varying predicate; one execute body
pub struct QueryMatch {
    pub matches: fn(&str, &GuidanceDb) -> bool,
    pub intent: QueryIntent,
}
fn execute_query(ctx: &WorkContext, config: &StagedConfig) -> Result<WorkOutput, WorkError> {
    run_staged_query(ctx, config)  // ONE body
}
```

**Detection:** If three implementations have word-for-word identical `execute` bodies, the trait is routing for the routing mechanism, not for polymorphism. Use a function-pointer array instead.

### ❌ `transmute` for binary IPC

```rust
// Wrong: undefined behavior if layout changes
let result: BinaryExecutionResult = unsafe { std::mem::transmute::<&[u8], _>(buf) };

// Right: explicit byte-order decoding
let version = u32::from_le_bytes(buf[4..8].try_into().unwrap());
```

### ❌ `FieldAccess` or `serde` in hot loops

```rust
// Wrong: string parsing on every iteration
for item in &items { item.set_field("count", &item.count.to_string()).unwrap(); }

// Right: direct field access
for item in &items { item.count = compute_count(); }
```

### ❌ Wrapping after type erasure

```rust
// Wrong: cannot inline through dyn Trait; two vtable calls
let unit: Arc<dyn WorkUnit> = Arc::new(MyUnit);
let wrapped = Instrumented { inner: unit };

// Right: wrap before storing in the registry; one vtable call total
let unit = Instrumented { inner: MyUnit };
registry.register(Arc::new(unit));
```

### ❌ Stack-allocating a struct that contains vtables

The most common memory bug in this pattern family. Heap-allocate any struct that stores vtable pointers internally. Use `Arc::new(...)`, never `let x = StructWithVtable { ... }` on the stack when the struct will be used as a trait object.

### ❌ Orchestrator branch-on-tier (cache cascade)

```rust
// Wrong: the orchestrator knows which tier comes next — tight coupling
fn route_with_depth(query: &str, depth: u8) -> Result<Arc<RoutingResult>> {
    if let Ok(result) = router.route(query) { return Ok(result); }       // L3
    if let Ok(result) = router.route_with_embedding(query) { ... }       // L4
    if let Some(subtasks) = decomposer.decompose(query) { ... }          // L4.5
    if let Ok(resp) = client.chat_complete(query) { ... }                // L5
    Err(CacheError::Miss)
}

// Right: each tier is an Arc<dyn Component>; the registry dispatches uniformly
let plan = self.tier_registry.execute(query, depth)?;
// Each tier's execute() receives the prior miss as its trigger via WorkContext
```

**Why it's wrong:** The orchestrator encodes domain knowledge about tier ordering, retry policy, and error propagation — violating the "orchestrator never branches on implementation type" principle (§10).

---

## 17. Pattern Selection Guide

**What this is.** A decision tree: for a given task, walk down the questions to
find the one pattern to reach for. If you remember nothing else, remember the
first three: *4+ constructor args → Builder; boundary string → serde or
FieldAccess; 2+ implementations → dyn Trait.*

```
Does construction have 4+ parameters?
  YES → #[derive(bon::Builder)]
  NO  → fn new() or struct literal

Does data arrive as a string from outside the process?
  YES → Type known at compile time?
    YES → serde (Tier 2)
    NO  → Schema known at runtime but values are typed?
      YES → Implement FieldAccess manually (Tier 3)
      NO  → HashMap<ArcIntern<str>, serde_json::Value> (Tier 4)
  NO  → Is the access in a hot loop?
    YES → Direct field access (Tier 1)
    NO  → Field name from runtime data?
      YES → FieldAccess trait (Tier 3)
      NO  → Direct field access (Tier 1)

Do you have 2+ concrete implementations today?
  YES → dyn Trait + Arc<dyn Trait>
  NO  → Concrete type (add the trait when the second implementation arrives)

Does a struct cross the WASM host/guest boundary?
  YES → #[repr(C, packed)] + explicit encode/decode
  NO  → Normal struct

Does a batch operation allocate many short-lived intermediates?
  YES → Scoped function with local Vecs (RAII)
  NO  → Normal ownership

Is an integer ID passed across module boundaries?
  YES → Newtype wrapper: struct NodeId(i64)
  NO  → Plain integer

Does the task need uniform orchestration (DAG, MCP, WASM)?
  YES → impl WorkUnit; if runtime-configurable, also FieldAccess + Describable → Component
  NO  → Concrete type with methods

Do multiple implementations share the same execute body, differing only in a predicate?
  YES → Function-pointer array (Vec<QueryMatch>) — not a trait
  NO  → Normal trait with multiple implementations

Do you need cross-cutting concerns?
  Type not yet erased (compile-time known) → Newtype wrapper (Pattern 3)
  Type already erased → Middleware (Pattern 9)

Do you need to adapt component behavior at runtime?
  YES → ComponentAdapter (Pattern 10)
  NO  → Use the component directly
```

## 18. Thread Safety

**What this section covers.** Rust's `Send`/`Sync` are compile-time, but *what
the pattern implies* is not automatic — a `dyn Trait` stored in an `Arc` is
only safe if every implementation is `Send + Sync`, and shared mutable state
still needs explicit protection. This section is the cheat-sheet for "which
pattern needs what," the shared-mutable-objects catalog, and the create/destroy
rules of thumb.

### Thread safety by pattern

| Pattern | Thread safety mechanism |
|---------|------------------------|
| `dyn Trait` + `Arc` | `Send + Sync` bounds enforced at compile time |
| `serde` | Stateless serialization — zero contention |
| `FieldAccess` on Rust structs | Requires `&mut self` — configure before sharing |
| `FieldAccess` on WASM/dynamic | Interior mutability (`Mutex`) inside the impl |
| `FieldAccess` on shared `Arc<dyn Component>` | `Arc::get_mut` succeeds only with exclusive ownership; the blanket impl returns `FieldError::ReadOnly` otherwise. Use `ComponentArcExt::try_as_any_mut` for safe fallback. |
| Newtype wrappers | No state — no contention |
| `bon::Builder` | Per-request, lock-free until `build()` |
| Scoped ownership | Stack-local — no sharing |
| `WorkUnit` | `Send + Sync` required; implementors must be thread-safe |
| `Middleware` | `Send + Sync` required; stateless middleware is zero-contention |
| `ComponentAdapter` | `Send + Sync` required; closures must be `Send + Sync` |
| `Scope` (`fluent-concurrency`) | Holds a `JoinSet` internally; not `Sync`. Use `Scope::defer()` to guarantee cleanup on drop. Dropping without `close().await` panics (a structured-concurrency violation). |
| `SupervisedBatch` (`fluent-concurrency`) | Holds a `JoinSet` and a per-batch `Runtime` reference. `SupervisedBatch::register` returns `Result<&mut Self, SupervisedBatchError>` — duplicate names are rejected with `Err(SupervisedBatchError::DuplicateName(_))`. |
| `Reserve` (`fluent-concurrency`) | RAII permit from a shared `AtomicUsize` counter. `Send + Sync` because the counter is `Arc`-shared. Drop without `commit()` returns the permit; `commit()` consumes it permanently. |
| Observability (Pattern 11) | There is **no** standalone `LogContext` type. Timing/observability compose `Instrumented` (wraps `WorkUnit`, logs via `tracing`) + `common_core::metrics::LatencyHistogram` (lock-free atomic histogram) — see §14. |

### Detailed rules

1. **Create trait objects on a single thread during initialization.** Do not create `Arc<dyn Trait>` handles concurrently.
2. **Shared registries require synchronization.** Use `Mutex`, `RwLock`, or `DashMap` for registries accessed from multiple threads.

   > **`DashMap` vs `RwLock<HashMap>`:** `DashMap` is a shard-lock map optimized for write concurrency. For read-dominated workloads (registries are typically read-heavy after initialization), `RwLock<HashMap>` is often faster because it allows fully parallel reads with no per-shard overhead. Profile before choosing `DashMap` for a hot registry.

3. **Destroy after all concurrent calls complete.** Before dropping an `Arc<dyn Trait>`, ensure all threads that hold a reference have finished.

### Shared mutable objects requiring explicit protection

| Object | Mechanism | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| `Library` | `Mutex<rusqlite::Connection>` | SQLite writes must serialize |
| `CapabilityRegistry` | `RwLock<HashMap<...>>` | Read-heavy concurrent intern calls |
| `L1Cache` | `DashMap<String, RoutingResult>` | Write-concurrent cache access |
| `WasmComponent.plugin` | `Mutex<extism::Plugin>` | Plugin state is not thread-safe |
| Observability (Pattern 11) | `Instrumented` + `LatencyHistogram` | No global mutable state; histogram is lock-free atomic |

### Typical usage pattern

```rust
// Init thread: create and share
let provider: Arc<dyn EmbeddingProvider> = Arc::new(OllamaProvider::new("model"));

// Worker threads: read-only through Arc
let p = provider.clone();
let handle = std::thread::spawn(move || { p.embed("hello").unwrap(); });

// After all workers join, drop is safe
handle.join().unwrap();
drop(provider);
```

## 19. Schema Evolution

**What this section covers.** Config and IPC schemas change over time; a
forward/backward-compatible migration plan is the difference between a safe
deploy and a data-corruption incident. This section is the versioning playbook
for `serde` (add-with-default, remove-with-skip, rename-with-alias, migration
functions) and for the binary IPC format (bump `BINARY_SCHEMA_VERSION`).

### Versioning with `serde`

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Config {
    #[serde(default = "default_port")]
    pub port: u16,
    #[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
    pub new_field: Option<String>,  // added in v1.1
}
```

### Field-level version annotations

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Config {
    #[serde(default = "default_port")]
    pub port: u16,

    #[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
    #[field(version_added = "1.1")]
    pub new_field: Option<String>,

    #[serde(skip)]
    #[field(version_removed = "2.0")]
    pub old_field: Option<String>,

    #[serde(alias = "old_name")]
    #[field(version_added = "1.2")]
    pub renamed_field: String,
}
```

### Migration functions

```rust
fn migrate_timeout<'de, D>(deserializer: D) -> Result<u64, D::Error>
where D: Deserializer<'de> {
    let value = serde_json::Value::deserialize(deserializer)?;
    match value {
        serde_json::Value::String(s) => parse_duration(&s).map_err(serde::de::Error::custom),
        serde_json::Value::Number(n) => n.as_u64().ok_or_else(|| serde::de::Error::custom("invalid")),
        _ => Err(serde::de::Error::custom("invalid timeout format")),
    }
}
```

### Binary IPC versioning

```rust
pub const BINARY_SCHEMA_VERSION: u32 = 1;

let version = u32::from_le_bytes(buf[4..8].try_into().unwrap());
if version != BINARY_SCHEMA_VERSION {
    return Err(IpcError::UnsupportedVersion);
}
```

### Upgrade matrix

| Change | Semver | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Add field with default | Minor | `#[serde(default)]` — backward compatible |
| Remove field | Major | `#[serde(skip)]` — forward compatible |
| Rename field | Major | `#[serde(alias = "old_name")]` on new field |
| Type change | Major | Old field + `deserialize_with` migration function |
| Binary IPC breaking change | Major | Bump `BINARY_SCHEMA_VERSION` |

## 20. Quick Reference for AI Agents

**What this is.** The "if I'm writing new code, which rule applies" checklist —
a numbered decision list (1–12) for what to do, and a numbered "never" list,
plus the throwaway rule and verification steps. Human coders can skip this
section; it exists so agents write idiomatic code without re-reading the whole
guide.

When writing new code in `rust-src/`:

1. **Check the source first.** Run `guidance explain "<topic>"` before writing. Check `dag/src/target.rs` for builders, `coral/src/tier_units.rs` for trait objects, `wasm_ipc/src/lib.rs` for binary IPC, `fluent-wvr/src/wrapper.rs` for adapters and wrappers.

2. **New multi-parameter construction** → `#[derive(bon::Builder)]`. Use `#[builder(default)]` for optional fields. Never write manual builders.

3. **New boundary serialization** → `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` with `#[serde(default)]` and `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]`.

4. **New runtime-configurable component** → Implement `FieldAccess` (instance method `field_names(&self)`), `Describable` (instance method `describe(&self)`), and `WorkUnit`. Then add `impl_component!(MyType);` after the three impls. There is **no blanket impl** — `impl_component!` is the canonical way to satisfy the supertrait. Both `field_names` and `describe` **must be instance methods** for trait-object dispatch to work.

5. **New cross-cutting logic** → Newtype wrapper **before type erasure** (Pattern 3). If the type is already erased, use Middleware (Pattern 9). Never wrap after type erasure. The canonical wrapper is `Instrumented::new(inner, label)` (timing/observability). Retry composes `common_core::retry` (async `retry_async` / sync `retry_call`) or the `SupervisedBatch` supervisor — never a blocking sleep inside `execute`.

6. **New subsystem with multiple implementations** → Define a trait with `Send + Sync`. Store as `Arc<dyn Trait>`. Never use `dyn Trait` with only one implementation.

7. **New WASM/binary IPC type** → `#[repr(C, packed)]` + explicit `to_le_bytes()` / `from_le_bytes()`. Validate magic + version first. Never `transmute`.

8. **New batch-processing loop** → Scoped function with local `Vec`s. RAII drops everything at scope exit. For long-lived async groups, use `Scope::defer()` instead of manually calling `close().await`; dropping a `Scope` without closing panics.

9. **New orchestratable task** → Implement `WorkUnit`. For runtime configurability, add `FieldAccess` + `Describable` and call `impl_component!` to become a `Component`. Store as `Arc<dyn Component>`. Use `SupervisedBatch::register` (returns `Result<&mut Self, SupervisedBatchError>`) to participate in a `SupervisedBatch` — the supervisor handles timeout, retry, and panic/fail distinct tracking.

10. **New request-scoped observability** → Wrap the unit in `Instrumented::with_metrics(inner, label, histogram)`. The histogram is `Arc<common_core::metrics::LatencyHistogram>`; p50/p99/count/sum are queryable after `execute`.

11. **New runtime adaptation** → Use `ComponentAdapter::new(arc).with_name_override("...").with_field_override("k", "v")` to layer runtime decisions on top of an existing `Component` without modifying it.

12. **New test component** → Use `fluent_wvr_testutil::StubComponent` for `ok`/`fail`/`panic`/`with_dep`/`with_provides`/`with_handler` builders. Avoid hand-rolled `WorkUnit + FieldAccess + Describable + impl_component!` quads in test code.

### Never do these

11. **Never use raw pointers for vtables.** Use `dyn Trait` + `Arc`.

12. **Never use `transmute` for binary IPC.** Use explicit byte-order encoding.

13. **Never use `dyn Trait` with only one implementation.**

14. **Never use `serde` or `FieldAccess` in hot loops.** Use direct field access.

15. **Never stack-allocate a struct that stores vtables.** Heap-allocate with `Arc::new(...)`.

16. **Never wrap after type erasure.** Wrap before storing in the registry.

17. **Never use the string reflection path in hot loops.** It allocates.

18. **Never apply Fluent Builder to a 3-parameter init.** Three params are readable.

19. **Never add `FieldAccess` to a type that never crosses a boundary.**

20. **Never create a trait speculatively.** Start with a concrete type.

21. **Never define `field_names` or `describe` as static associated functions.** They must be `&self` instance methods for trait-object dispatch.

22. **Never hand-write `as_any`/`as_any_mut`.** Use `impl_component!`.

23. **Never drop a `Scope` without closing.** Use `Scope::defer()` or `scope.close().await` — drop without close panics.

24. **Never treat `WorkError::Execution` as a panic.** Handler errors land in `SupervisedBatchSummary::failed`; only `JoinError::is_panic()` lands in `panicked`.

### The throwaway rule

25. **Never add a new public API surface (function, type, error variant, or builder helper) without at least one in-tree production consumer.** The codebase has a documented rule against throwaway additions — three APIs shipped in a prior roadmap cycle (`Reserve`, `FieldError::ReadOnly`, `WorkContext::for_unit_in_batch`) had no production consumer on landing. The cost shows up in unused code paths, surprise behaviour, and dead documentation. If a feature must ship ahead of its consumer, file a tracking issue and link it from the API's doc comment.

26. **Compatibility surface is a deliberate, marked exception.** A trait/type kept for forward compatibility (the `FieldAccess`/`Describable` reflection surface, `SchemaProvider`, `PersistableComponent`, `DynamicComponent`, `Reserve`, `PartitionedRouter`) is not "throwaway" *when it is explicitly marked as such in its doc comment and in the §0 status taxonomy*. Marking is what distinguishes scaffold (keep, maintain contract) from dead code (prune). Any API that is neither production-composed nor marked scaffold is a throwaway-rule candidate and should be pruned.

### Verification

28. **Run `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` before finishing.** The project enforces `#![deny(warnings)]`. (Pre-existing `uninlined_format_args` warnings at `fluent-wvr/src/work.rs:278,284` are grandfathered — do not introduce more.)

29. **Run `cargo test --workspace` before finishing.** All workspace tests must pass. (The count is not documented — it changes too quickly to be a stable reference.)

30. **Check for `unsafe` blocks.** The workspace has 3 `unsafe` blocks, all in `wasm_ipc/src/lib.rs` for `read_unaligned` of packed struct fields. Every new `unsafe` block must be justified and documented; the `forbid(unsafe_code)` lint is set at the crate level for both `fluent-wvr` and `fluent-concurrency`.

31. **Run `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps` before finishing.** Doc warnings are part of the quality bar.

---

## 21. Companion crate: `fluent-concurrency`

**What this covers.** The `Component`/`WorkUnit` framework is the *control
plane*: it says what a unit *is* and how it is configured and composed. The
`fluent-concurrency` crate is the *runtime*: it actually runs units with
supervision, retry, timeout, and dependency-aware cancellation. If you know
Go's goroutines + wait groups but want panic-aware structured concurrency, or
C++'s async futures and want cancellation, this is the crate. The table below
is the index; the full semantics live in
`doc/skills/fluent-concurrency/SKILL.md`.

The trait framework in `fluent-wvr` is paired with a structured-concurrency
runtime in `fluent-concurrency`. The full surface is documented in
`doc/skills/fluent-concurrency/SKILL.md`. The high-level primitives are:

| Primitive | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `Runtime` (trait) | `fluent-concurrency/src/runtime/` | Pluggable backend: `TokioRuntime` (production), `TestRuntime` (deterministic, paused-time), `NoopRuntime` (in `fluent-wvr/src/runtime.rs`, init-only) |
| `Capability` + `CapabilitySet` | `fluent-wvr/src/capability.rs` | Type-map of capability tokens; `with`/`get`/`remove`/`remove_as`/`contains`/`iter`/`len`/`is_empty` |
| `Scope` | `fluent-concurrency/src/scope.rs` | Structured concurrency; `spawn` + `close().await` or `defer()`; drop-without-close panics |
| `SupervisedBatch` | `fluent-concurrency/src/batch.rs` | `Scope` + dependency graph + panic/fail/cancel distinct tracking; `SupervisedBatchSummary { completed, panicked, failed, cancelled }`; `SupervisedBatch::register` returns `Result<_, SupervisedBatchError>`; `SupervisedBatchError::DuplicateName`; configurable retry backoff (`backoff_base_ms` / `backoff_jitter_ms`) |
| `WorkerPool<T>` | `fluent-concurrency/src/pool.rs` | Bounded FIFO worker pool; capacity + backpressure |
| `ResultPool<T, R, E>` | `fluent-concurrency/src/pool.rs` | Worker pool that returns a typed `Result<R, ResultPoolError<E>>`; `ResultPoolError` is `Inner(E) \| Canceled \| Pool(PoolError)` |
| `PriorityResultPool<T, R, E>` | `fluent-concurrency/src/pool.rs` | Priority-ordered variant, bounded (`BoundedPriorityQueue`, `std::sync::Mutex` backing, backpressured `submit`); `new` sizes the queue to `cap*4`, `with_queue_capacity` overrides; workers drain fully before blocking |
| `Limiter` | `fluent-concurrency/src/pool.rs` | Concurrency cap (N-at-a-time), no queue |
| `Queue<T>` | `fluent-concurrency/src/pool.rs` | Bounded async FIFO; `PoolError::Full` on overflow; `std::sync::Mutex` backing (never held across an await) |
| `PriorityQueue<T>` | `fluent-concurrency/src/queue.rs` | O(log P) for distinct priorities, O(1) for all-zero fast path; `BoundedPriorityQueue` adds the `Queue`-style close-wakes-waiters wrapper |
| `PartitionedRouter<K, J>` | `fluent-concurrency/src/router.rs` | Hash-based sharding; preserves causal ordering per key; **compatibility surface (scaffold)** |
| `first_accept_in_order` | `fluent-concurrency/src/ladder.rs` | Monomorphized first-Ok-wins fallback combinator ("try rungs in order, take the first success"); the canonical ladder primitive composed by `BackendChain`, `dispatch_real`, and the router's escalation ladder |
| `CreditFlow` | `fluent-concurrency/src/flow.rs` | Sender/receiver backpressure with `CreditSpec { initial, more_after }`; **production** — gates the router's ledger tier feed (`LedgerTierWorker::enqueue_with_credit` / `recv()` per processed node) |
| `Reserve` | `fluent-concurrency/src/reserve.rs` | RAII permit from a shared `AtomicUsize`; `try_acquire`/`commit`; **compatibility surface (scaffold)** — no in-tree production consumer; kept as the low-level permit seam |

A `SupervisedBatch` is a `Scope` plus the `WorkUnit` integration: tasks implement
`Component` and are registered with `batch.register(arc).unwrap()`.
The `SupervisedBatch` runs each unit through `execute_with_timeout_and_retry`
using the per-unit `default_timeout_ms()` and the SupervisedBatch-wide
`max_retries`/`timeout_ms` set on the `WorkContext`. The four-way
summary discriminates: `Ok(_)` → `completed`, `Err(WorkError::*)` →
`failed`, `JoinError::is_panic()` → `panicked`, `JoinError::is_cancelled()`
or `Timeout` → `cancelled` (with `CancelReason::{Timeout, DependencyFailed, Aborted}`).
