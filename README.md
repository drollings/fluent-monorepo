# explain-gen

A Zig-native, deterministic codebase documentation engine.  It analyzes source
files via AST, generates structured JSON guidance in `.explain-gen/`, and
exposes an AI-assisted query layer through the Makefile — with minimal footprint
so it can drop into any project.

## Authorship and copyright

This code is authored by Daniel Rollings, February 2026, with a mixture of
elements from previous hand-written projects in Python and C++, rendered
into Zig with ease of extensibility into other languages.

It is released under a dual GPL/Commercial license.  See below.

## What it does

- **Bottom-up documentation**: Parses source files (Zig, Python, …) and emits
  per-file `*.json` guidance files that capture module purpose, function
  signatures, design patterns, reverse dependencies, and AI-generated comments.
- **STRUCTURE.md synthesis**: Aggregates all guidance JSON into a human-legible
  codebase map that AI agents can traverse without MCP or tool calls.
- **Incremental RALPH loop**: The Makefile chains `build → test → guidance sync
  → lint → STRUCTURE.md` with per-file stamp files so only changed files are
  re-processed.
- **Multi-language via providers**: `bin/explain-gen-py` handles Python; future
  providers (`explain-gen-cpp`, `explain-gen-php`, …) follow the same
  `sync --file src --scan` contract.
- **Knowledge management**: `make explain`, `make query`, `make learn`, and
  `make diary` give AI agents a structured way to read, annotate, and promote
  codebase knowledge without hallucinating file paths.

## Quick start

```bash
# Install toolchain (requires mise)
mise install          # installs Zig + Python + uv from mise.toml

# Set up Python provider venv
make env-init

# Build the Zig binary
make build            # → zig-out/bin/explain-gen

# Run the full RALPH loop gate
make pre-commit

# Query the guidance index
make explain QUERY="sync guidance json"
make query   QUERY="ring buffer"
```

## Adding a new language provider

Create `bin/explain-gen-<lang>` and ensure it accepts:

```
explain-gen-<lang> sync --file <path> --output <guidance_dir> [--infill]
explain-gen-<lang> sync --scan <dir>  --output <guidance_dir> [--infill]
```

Output JSON must follow the canonical schema:

```json
{
  "meta":     { "module": "…", "source": "…", "language": "…" },
  "comment":  "one-line module description",
  "skills":   [],
  "hashtags": [],
  "used_by":  [],
  "members":  [ { "type", "name", "is_pub", "line", "signature", "comment", … } ]
}
```

Register the provider in `.explain-gen/explain-gen-config.json` under
`providers`.

## Configuration

`.explain-gen/explain-gen-config.json` controls model selection and
provider registration.  All Makefile targets read from this file.
